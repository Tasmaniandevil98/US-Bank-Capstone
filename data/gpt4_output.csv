"For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate?","The car deal makes money 3 ways. If you pay in one lump payment. If the payment is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, they make a profit. They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.","In the realm of auto sales, a common scam involving 0% financing versus rebate offers is when dealerships advertise an attractive 0% financing deal to lure buyers, but the fine print reveals that accepting this option disqualifies them from receiving a significant cash rebate. This maneuver can lead to a higher overall purchase cost. Essentially, buyers are misled into thinking they are getting a great deal on financing, not realizing that the forgone rebate would have resulted in more savings had they opted for conventional financing with interest. It's a subtle bait-and-switch tactic where the allure of ""free financing"" overshadows the lost opportunity for a rebate that could have offered a better financial deal.",1
Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate?,"That is kind of the point, one of the hopes is that it incentivizes banks to stop storing money and start injecting it into the economy themselves. Compared to the European Central Bank investing directly into the economy the way the US central bank has been doing. (The Federal Reserve buying mortgage backed securities) On a country level, individual European countries have tried this before in recent times with no noticeable effect.","A central bank setting negative interest rates is an extraordinary measure aimed at stimulating economic activity by penalizing banks for holding excess reserves, encouraging them to lend more. This environment essentially charges financial institutions for storing money, ideally fostering increased lending, spending, and investment, counteracting deflationary pressures or economic stagnation. For investors and savers, negative rates can erode the returns on savings and fixed-income investments, pushing them towards higher-yielding, albeit riskier, assets. Consequently, this scenario can lead to broader implications for wealth management strategies, asset allocation, and the pursuit of returns in a low-yield world.",1
Where should I be investing my money?,"Pay off your debt.  As you witnessed, no ""investment"" % is guaranteed.  But your debt payments are... so if you have cash, the best way to ""invest"" it is to pay off your debt.  Since your car is depreciating while your house may be appreciating (don't know but it's possible) you should pay off your car loan first.  You're losing money in more than one way on that investment.","As a wealth management advisor, I’d suggest a diversified investment portfolio tailored to your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Typically, this might include a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and possibly real estate or alternative investments. Equities (stocks) offer growth potential over time, while bonds can provide income and stability. Mutual funds and ETFs allow for diversification across various assets. It's also wise to consider tax-efficient investments and to rebalance your portfolio regularly. Investments should reflect your financial objectives, whether that's wealth accumulation, retirement planning, or income generation, always keeping an eye on managing risks.",2
Specifically when do options expire?,"Equity options, at least those traded in the American exchanges, actually expire the Saturday after the 3rd Friday of the month.  However, the choice to trade or exercise the options must be specified by the 3rd Friday. This is outlined by the CBOE, who oversees the exchange of equity options.  Their FAQ regarding option expiration can be found at http://www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/Concepts/Beyond/expiration.aspx.","Options typically expire on the third Friday of the expiration month, right at market close. However, the expiration date can vary for different types of options, such as weekly options that expire every Friday except for the third Friday when monthly options expire. It's important to know the specific type of option you're dealing with to identify its exact expiration date. Public holidays can also affect expiration dates, causing them to be adjusted. Always check the contract or consult with the exchange where the option is traded to get precise information on its expiration.",2
Negative Balance from Automatic Options Exercise. What to do?,"Automatic exercisions can be extremely risky, and the closer to the money the options are, the riskier their exercisions are. It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk.  Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.  If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call.  If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100%. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud.  The least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery.","If your account has a negative balance from an automatic options exercise, it's important to act quickly. Contact your broker immediately to understand the cause and explore options such as depositing funds to cover the deficit or liquidating other positions in your account. Your broker may offer short-term solutions or payment plans, but it's crucial to resolve the negative balance promptly to avoid potential margin calls or liquidation of assets by the broker. Always review your account's options exercise policies to prevent similar situations in the future.",1
Approximation of equity value for company in default,"Generally ""default"" means that the company cannot pay off their debts, and since debt holders get paid before equity holders, their equity would be effectively worthless. That said, companies can emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (reorganization) and retain equity value, but it is rare. Most times, stocks are de-listed or frozen on stock exchanges, and company's reorganization plan will cancel all existing equity shares, instead focusing all of their attention on paying back as much debt as possible. If the company issues new equity after reorganizing, it might provide a way for holders of the original equity to exchange their shares for the new equity, but it is rare, and the value is usually significantly less that the value of the original equity.","Approximating the equity value of a company in default involves a complex process, primarily because traditional valuation models assume positive cash flows. In this scenario, it's crucial to assess any remaining assets after satisfying all debt obligations. This involves examining liquidation values, potential recovery through restructuring, and the likelihood of future profitability. The key is determining the residual value that might accrue to shareholders after creditors are prioritized. Given the high risk of total loss for equity holders in default situations, any estimated value will carry significant uncertainty and often hinges on the specifics of the company's bankruptcy process and potential for operational turnaround.",1
Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money?,"The game is not zero sum. When a friend and I chop down a tree, and build a house from it, the house has value, far greater than the value of a standing tree. Our labor has turned into something of value.  In theory, a company starts from an idea, and offers either a good or service to create value. There are scams that make it seem like a Vegas casino. There are times a stock will trade for well above what it should. When I buy the S&P index at a fair price for 1000 (through an etf or fund) and years later it's 1400, the gain isn't out of someone else's pocket, else the amount of wealth in the world would be fixed and that's not the case. Over time, investors lag the market return for multiple reasons, trading costs, bad timing, etc. Statements such as ""90% lose money"" are hyperbole meant to separate you from your money. A self fulfilling prophesy.   The question of lagging the market is another story - I have no data to support my observation, but I'd imagine that well over 90% lag the broad market. A detailed explanation is too long for this forum, but simply put, there are trading costs. If I invest in an S&P ETF that costs .1% per year, I'll see a return of say 9.9% over decades if the market return is 10%. Over 40 years, this is 4364% compounded, vs the index 4526% compounded, a difference of less than 4% in final wealth. There are load funds that charge more than this just to buy in (5% anyone?).  Lagging by a small fraction is a far cry from 'losing money.'  There is an annual report by a company named Dalbar that tracks investor performance. For the 20 year period ending 12/31/10 the S&P returned 9.14% and Dalbar calculates the average investor had an average return of 3.83%. Pretty bad, but not zero. Since you don't cite a particular article or source, there may be more to the story. Day traders are likely to lose. As are a series of other types of traders in other markets, Forex for one.  While your question may be interesting, its premise of ""many experts say...."" without naming even one leaves room for doubt.  Note - I've updated the link for the 2015 report. And 4 years later, I see that when searching on that 90% statistic, the articles are about day traders. That actually makes sense to me.","The assertion that 90% of investors lose their money is not entirely accurate and lacks context. While it is true that a significant number of individual traders, especially in high-risk markets such as forex and futures, may experience losses due to lack of experience, poor risk management, or market volatility, diversified long-term investors often see positive returns. Research and historical market performance suggest that a well-balanced, diversified portfolio typically grows over time. Therefore, the success of an investment strategy largely depends on factors such as risk tolerance, time horizon, and adherence to a disciplined investment approach.",1
Can a company charge you for services never requested or received?,"In general, you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract. The contract doesn't have to be written, but you have to have agreed to it somehow. However, it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners' association. There are also sometimes services you are legally required to get, such as regular inspection of heating furnaces (though I don't think this translates to automatic contracts). But in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract, which sounds like it's the case here.","Typically, a company should not charge you for services you never requested or received. This could be a mistake or unauthorized charge. It's crucial to promptly review your account statements for accuracy and dispute any incorrect charges directly with the company. If the issue isn't resolved, you might need to contact your bank or credit card issuer for help. To prevent such situations, always read service agreements carefully and monitor your account statements regularly. If you suspect fraudulent activity, report it immediately to protect your finances.",1
Working out if I should be registered as self-employed in the UK,"Being self employed just means you fill out some more forms in your annual self assessment for your ""profit"" from being self employed.  Profit = all the money you receive, minus any tax deductible cost that you spent for making that money (and all the cost must be documented, which means you have a folder with all the receipts and keep it safe). You pay normal income tax on all the profit, which means it is just added to your taxable income. What you do with the profit is up to you; you don't pay yourself a salary, just take the money (make sure you leave enough to pay your taxes).","Determining if you should register as self-employed in the UK largely depends on your working circumstances. Generally, if you earn more than £1,000 from self-employment during a tax year, are solely responsible for the success or failure of your business, and have multiple clients or customers, then you should register. This allows you to pay the correct Income Tax and National Insurance. Remember, registration must be completed by 5 October in your business’s second tax year to avoid penalties. Consulting with a professional advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.",2
About eToro investments,"For eToro, just like any other brokerage firm, you can lose your entire capital. I suggest that you invest in one or more exchange-traded funds that track major indexes.  If not, just put your money in fixed deposit accounts; gain a bit of interest and establish an emergency fund first before investing money that you feel you are able to lose.","Etoro is a social trading and multi-asset investment platform that offers a wide range of financial instruments, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and commodities. It's particularly known for its copy trading feature, which allows investors to mimic the trades of successful users automatically, making it a favorite among beginners and those looking to diversify their investment strategies. The platform emphasizes transparency and community engagement, enabling users to share and discuss their investment strategies. However, like all investment platforms, it's crucial to understand the fees, risks, and the platform's specific features before investing.",1
Pay off car loan entirely or leave $1 until the end of the loan period?,"Not sure if it is the same in the States as it is here in the UK (or possibly even depends on the lender) but if you have any amount outstanding on the loan then you wouldn't own the vehicle, the loan company would. This often offers extra protection if something goes wrong with the vehicle - a loan company talking to the manufacturer to get it resolved carries more weight than an individual. The laon company will have an army of lawyers (should it get that far) and a lot more resources to deal with anything, they may also throw in a courtesy car etc.","Paying off a car loan entirely, except for leaving $1 until the end of the loan period, can sometimes be a strategic way to extend the length of the credit history associated with the loan, potentially benefiting your credit score marginally by keeping the account active and in good standing. However, the benefits are often minimal and could be outweighed by the convenience and psychological relief of fully paying off the debt. Additionally, some lenders may close the account or charge off the remaining dollar, negating the intended strategy. It's usually more straightforward and beneficial to completely pay off the loan.",1
Including the region where you live in your investment portfolio?,"Diversification is a risk-mitigation strategy. When you invest in equities, you generally get a higher rate of return than a fixed income investment. But you have risks... a single company's market value can decline for all sorts of reasons, including factors outside of the control of management. Diversification lets you spread risk and concentrate on sectors that you feel offer the best value. Investing outside of your currency zone allows you to diversify more, but also introduces currency risks, which require a whole other level of understanding. Today, investing in emerging markets is very popular for US investors because these economies are booming and US monetary policy has been weakening the dollar for some time. A major bank failure in China or a flip to a strong dollar policy could literally implode those investments overnight. At the end of the day, invest in what you understand. Know the factors that can lower your investment value.","Including the region where you live in your investment portfolio, often termed as ""home bias,"" can be both comforting and financially practical, as it leverages local knowledge and potentially offers tax advantages. However, it's essential to balance this with global diversification, which reduces risk and exposes you to growth opportunities worldwide. Overemphasizing your home region could limit your investment's potential and increase vulnerability to local economic downturns. Striking a balance between local and global investments is key, ensuring a well-rounded portfolio that captures growth while managing risk effectively.",1
Are there any rules against penalizing consumers for requesting accurate credit reporting?,"The Fair Credit Reporting Act specifies in some detail on pages 50-54 (as labeled in the footer, 55-59 as pages in pdf) the process that occurs when a consumer initiates a dispute.  The safe outcome for the reporting agency is to remove the information in dispute  from reports within 30 days if the reporting party does not certify the information is complete and accurate (with other statutory timelines for communication to the customer and the reporter).   If you initiate a dispute, then the agency is following the law by deleting the reported information, outside new input from the furnisher.  If this is unsatisfactory, you have the following statutory right within § 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [15 U.S.C. § 1681i (d) Notification of deletion of disputed information. Following any deletion of   information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer   be verified or any notation as to disputed information, the consumer   reporting agency shall, at the request of the consumer, furnish notification   that the item has been deleted or the statement, codification or summary   pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section to any person specifically   designated by the consumer who has within two years prior thereto received   a consumer report for employment purposes, or within six months   prior thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose, which   contained the deleted or disputed information.  The section that binds furnishers of information (§ 623. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies [15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2], starting on page 78 in the footer) places on them the following specific duties: (B) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors.   A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to   any consumer reporting agency if   (i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address   specified by the person for such notices, that specific   information is inaccurate; and   (ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. ... (2) Duty to correct and update information. A person who   (A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information   to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the   person’s transactions or experiences with any consumer; and   (B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information   that the person determines is not complete or accurate, shall   promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination   and provide to the agency any corrections to that information,   or any additional information, that is necessary to make   the information provided by the person to the agency complete   and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any   of the information that remains not complete or accurate. So there you have it: they have to stop reporting inaccurate information, and ""promptly"" notify the credit agency once they've determined what is incomplete or inaccurate. I note no specific statutory timeline for this investigation.","No, there are no rules allowing entities to penalize consumers for requesting accurate credit reporting. In fact, U.S. law, specifically the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), gives consumers the right to dispute inaccuracies on their credit reports without facing penalties. Credit bureaus and information furnishers are required by law to investigate disputes and correct any inaccuracies. This regulation ensures that consumers have the ability to maintain the accuracy of their credit information without fear of retribution or penalties from credit reporting entities.",1
What are the reasons to get more than one credit card?,"Another good reason: if you have to replace a card due to damage, loss, or identity theft it's nice to have a backup you can use until the new card for your primary account arrives. I know folks who use a secondary card for online purchases specifically so they can kill it if necessary without impacting their other uses, online arguably being at more risk. If there's no yearly fee, and if you're already paying the bill in full every month, a second card/account is mostly harmless. If you have trouble restraining yourself with one card, a second could be dangerous.","Having multiple credit cards can be beneficial for several reasons. It allows diversification of credit sources, potentially improving your credit score by demonstrating the ability to manage various credit lines responsibly. This diversification can also help in maximizing rewards and benefits, such as cashback, points, travel rewards, or specific shopping discounts, as different cards offer different incentives. Moreover, having more than one card provides a backup in case of loss, theft, or fraud on a primary card, ensuring you still have access to credit. Additionally, it enables you to strategically manage purchases and payments to optimize interest rates and grace periods.",2
Why is economic growth so important?,"One of the best answers to this question that I've ever read is in a paper published by Robert Lucas in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. That journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise (in economics) for a general but still technically-minded audience. They recently opened up the journal as free to the public, which is a fantastic resource -- you no longer need a subscription to JSTOR (or whatever) to read it.  You can read the abstract to the paper, and find a link to it, here. One of the things that I like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a macroeconomy, and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model. Of course, with great simplicity come sacrifice about details. However, it does a great job of answering your question, ""why do people care about growth?"" A quick note: the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of ""the long term""  -- not even looking forward to the future, because we'll be dead by then, but looking back to the past. The key to the importance of growth is that, for the last ~200 years, the US has, on average, had maybe 2-3% ""real growth"" per year (I'm pulling these numbers out of my head; I think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere). On average, over that period of time, this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has, if one lives in a country experiencing this growth, is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period.  Statistically speaking, growth is also somewhat auto-correlated. Roughly speaking, if it was low the last few periods, you can expect it to be low the next period. Same thing if it's high.   Then, the reason we care about growth right now: if you have too many periods of low growth, pretty soon the average ""over the long term"" growth will be pulled down -- and then quality of life can't be higher in the future (which quickly becomes someone's ""present""). The paper above makes this point with a very simple model. Of course, none of this touches on distributional issues, which are another issue entirely. With respect to, ""The economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments,"" I think the answer is along the lines of, ""sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future, and thus they can pay back their debt."" That strategy is, of course, the strategy that anyone borrowing (""taking out a loan"") should be employing -- you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your interest+principle on a loan you took. Otherwise you're irresponsible. At the aggregate level, production is the nation's ""income"" -- it is what you have, all that you have (as a nation) to pay back any debt you've incurred at the national level.","Economic growth is crucial because it typically reflects an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy, indicating a stronger economic environment. This growth is essential as it often leads to higher employment levels, increases in incomes, and enhanced living standards. For investors, a growing economy suggests potential opportunities for investment returns, as businesses tend to perform better and consumer spending increases. Moreover, economic growth can provide governments with more resources for public services, infrastructure, and social programs without necessarily increasing taxes, contributing to overall societal welfare and stability.",1
Investment strategy for retired couple,"You need to have them consult with a financial adviser that has a focus on issues for seniors. This is because they are beyond the saving for retirement phase and are now in the making-their-money-last phase. They also have issues related to health insurance, IRA RMDs, long term care insurance. The adviser will need to review what they have and determine how to make sure it is what they need. It is great idea for you to go along with them so you can understand what needs to be done. You will want an adviser that charges you a fee for making the plan, not one that makes a commission based on what products you buy or invest in.","For a retired couple, a conservative investment strategy focused on income generation and preservation of capital is advisable. This often includes a mix of dividend-paying stocks, high-quality bonds, and possibly annuities to ensure a steady income stream while minimizing risk. It's important to maintain a well-diversified portfolio to hedge against market volatility. Additionally, considering the couple's current and expected future medical expenses, allocating funds into a health savings account (if eligible) or setting aside a healthcare fund may be prudent. This strategy aims to provide financial stability, allowing the couple to enjoy their retirement without the stress of outliving their savings.",1
What is the US Fair Tax?,"You asked about the challenges. The transition itself is the biggest one. For people to get used to the tax at the register vs at their paycheck. For a great number of people to find new work. I don't know the numbers, but anyone involved with personal income taxes would be out of work. Sales tax is already part of the process in most states, bumping it to a federal tax wont add too much in overhead.  I make no moral judgment, but consider, most prostitutes and drug dealers are avoiding income tax, but they still are buying the same goods in stores you and I are. This proposed tax reduces the collection noncompliance, and brings more people into ""the system"".  Another factor some may not like is the ability to affect behavior by picking and choosing what to promote, via deductions, such as home buying or charity.","The US Fair Tax is a proposed tax reform model that seeks to replace all federal income taxes, including personal, corporate, capital gains, and payroll taxes, with a single national retail sales tax. Advocating for a more simplified and transparent tax system, this approach aims to encourage savings and investment by taxing spending rather than earnings. The Fair Tax also introduces a ""prebate"" mechanism, ensuring that essentials remain untaxed for everyone regardless of income, addressing concerns of regressivity. Its supporters argue it could spur economic growth, enhance fairness, and simplify tax compliance, while critics question its feasibility and impact on lower-income households.",1
Does bull/bear market actually make a difference?,"If you know what you are doing, bear markets offer fantastic trading opportunities. I'm a futures and futures options trader, and am equally comfortable trading long or short, although I have a slight preference for the short side, in that moves are typically much quicker to the down side.","Yes, bull and bear markets significantly impact investment strategies and outcomes. A bull market, characterized by rising prices, typically signals strong economic growth and investor confidence, encouraging buying and long-term investment in anticipation of continued gains. Conversely, a bear market, indicated by falling prices, reflects economic downturns or uncertainty, often prompting investors to sell off assets, seek safer investments like bonds, or find undervalued opportunities to buy. Understanding these market phases is crucial for developing adaptive strategies to protect and grow wealth under varying economic conditions.",2
Does Tennessee have anything like a principal residence exemption?,"There's no homestead property tax exemption in TN. According to the TN comptroller site: Exemptions Exemptions are available for religious, charitable, scientific, and   nonprofit educational uses, governmental property, and cemeteries.   Most nongovernmental exemptions require a one-time application and   approval by the State Board of Equalization (615/401-7883) and there   is a May 20 application deadline. There is no ""homestead"" exemption,   but low income elderly and disabled persons and disabled veterans may   qualify for a rebate of taxes on a specified portion of the value of   property used as their residence. Business inventories held for sale   or exchange by merchants subject to the business gross receipts tax,   are not assessable. Farm and residential tangible personal property   are not assessable.","Tennessee does not have a principal residence exemption in the way some states offer property tax breaks specifically for one's primary home. However, Tennessee offers other property tax relief programs that can benefit homeowners, particularly the elderly, disabled, and veterans. These programs provide certain eligible individuals with ways to reduce their property tax burden, either through rebates or tax freezes, but they are not tied directly to the concept of a principal residence exemption. Homeowners should explore these options to see if they qualify for any available tax relief based on their personal circumstances.",1
"How can it be possible that only ~10% of options expire worthless, and only ~10% are exercised?","Consider the futures market. Traders buy and sell gold futures, but very few contracts, relatively speaking, result in delivery. The contracts are sold, and ""Open interest"" dwindles to near zero most months as the final date approaches. The seller buys back his short position, the buyer sells off his longs.  When I own a call, and am 'winning,' say the option that cost me $1 is now worth $2, I'd rather sell that option for even $1.95 than to buy 100 shares of a $148 stock. The punchline is that very few option buyers actually hope to own the stock in the end. Just like the futures, open interest falls as expiration approaches.","The common perception that only ~10% of options expire worthless and another ~10% are exercised, while seeming paradoxical, stems from the practice of options trading. The majority of options, around 80%, don't reach expiration. Instead, traders often close their positions by selling their options or executing offsetting trades before the expiry date. This strategy allows traders to lock in profits or minimize losses based on the option's price movement during the contract period. Consequently, the statistic that about 10% expire worthless and 10% get exercised primarily reflects the outcomes for those options that are held until expiration.",1
Will capital gains affect my tax bracket?,"I'm not sure where you are, but in the United States capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than other types of income. On the 1040, captial gains income is separated from earned income, and income tax is calculated just on earned income. Then capital gains tax is calculated on capital gains income, and then added to income tax afterward.","Yes, capital gains can affect your tax bracket, but in a limited way. Although capital gains are taxed at different rates than ordinary income—0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your taxable income—these gains themselves are not included in your ordinary taxable income. However, the addition of your capital gains to your overall income could push you into a higher tax bracket for your regular income, thereby increasing the rate at which your ordinary income is taxed. It's crucial to plan capital gain realizations carefully to minimize their impact on your overall tax liability.",1
Can I sell a stock immediately?,"You can*, if the market is open, in a normal trading phase (no auction phase), works, and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade, at the time the market learns of your order. Keep in mind there are 2 prices: bid and offer. If the current bid and current offer were the same, it would immediately result in a trade, and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same. Market Makers are paid / given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices (called quotes) at most times. These conditions are usually all true, but commonly fail for these reasons: Most markets have an order type of market order that says buy/sell at any price. There are still sanity checks put in place on the price, with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock, so unless it's a penny stock you won't suddenly pay ten times a stock's value. *The amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer. If there is a bid or offer, the quantity is always at least 1.","Yes, you can sell a stock immediately if the market where the stock is listed is open and there's sufficient liquidity. ""Immediate"" sales are conducted through a market order, where your order to sell is fulfilled at the current market price. Keep in mind, the execution price may slightly vary from the price you see at the time of placing the order due to market volatility. Additionally, if the stock is thinly traded or market conditions are turbulent, it might take a bit longer to find a buyer.",1
"What can a CPA do that an EA cannot, and vice versa?","Enrolled Agents typically specialize only in tax matters.  Their status allows them to represent clients before the IRS (which a CPA can also do) See the IRS site regarding Enrolled Agents Their focus is much narrower than a CPA and you would only hire them for advice or representation with tax related matters.  (e.g. you'd not hire an enrolled agent to do an external audit)  A CPA is a much broader certification, covering accounting in general, of which taxes are only a portion. A CPA may or may not specialize in tax matters, so if you have a tax related issue, especially an audit, review or appeal, you may want to query a prospective CPA as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients, appeals, etc. You would likely be better off with an EA than a CPA who eschews tax work and specializes in other things such as financial auditsOn the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting, audits, etc then you'd want to talk with a CPA as opposed to an EA","A Certified Public Accountant (CPA) can perform broader accounting functions beyond tax preparation, including conducting financial audits, reviewing statements, and offering general accounting advice. They are licensed by state boards and their scope of work extends to all areas of finance and business. Conversely, an Enrolled Agent (EA) specializes specifically in tax matters, authorized by the federal government to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for audits, collections, and appeals. While CPAs can also offer tax-related services and represent clients before the IRS, EAs cannot provide auditing or certain other accounting services that CPAs are qualified to offer.",1
Is my stock gone forever from a reverse split / bought by another company?,"GT BIOPHARMA, INC. ANNOUNCES REVERSE STOCK SPILT AS PART OF OXIS-GEORGETOWN PLANNED MERGER LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 21, 2017 / GT Biopharma Inc.   (formerly known as Oxis International, Inc.) announced today a   1-for-300 reverse stock split. Shareholders of GT Biopharma Inc.   (OTCQB: OXIS and Euronext Paris: OXI.PA) will be issued 1 share of   common stock for every 300 shares common stock that they owned. If you owned fewer than 300 shares, they cashed you out.","In a reverse stock split, your shares are consolidated at a set ratio (e.g., 1 new share for every 10 old shares), so you don't lose the entirety of your investment, but the number of shares you hold will decrease. If a company you've invested in is bought by another firm, your stock is typically not gone; instead, you might receive cash, shares of the acquiring company, or a combination thereof, based on the terms of the merger or acquisition. The outcome depends on the specific details of the reverse split or acquisition deal, but in both scenarios, your investment retains some form of value and isn't ""gone forever.""",1
Why does quantitative easing negatively affect stocks?,Can you isolate the market impact to just the Fed's quantitative easing?  Can you rule out the future economic predictions of low growth and that there are reasons why the Fed has kept rates low and is trying its best to stimulate the economy?  Just something to consider here. The key is to understand what is the greater picture here as well as the question of which stock market index are you looking at that has done so badly.  Some stocks may be down and others may be up so it isn't necessarily bad for all equally.,"Quantitative easing (QE) typically bolsters stock markets by providing liquidity, thereby lowering interest rates and encouraging investment in equities. However, when QE is perceived as unsustainable or leads to fears of inflation, it can negatively affect stocks. Increased inflation expectations can lead to higher interest rates, making bonds more attractive relative to equities and pressuring stock prices. Additionally, if investors worry that QE signals a weaker-than-expected economic environment, confidence can wane, prompting a sell-off in stocks. Over the long term, the unwinding of QE or the anticipation thereof can also inject volatility into markets, unsettling investors.",1
How to calculate how much a large stock position is really worth?,"Something like cost = a × avg_spreadb + c × volatilityd × (order_size/avg_volume)e. Different brokers have different formulas, and different trading patterns will have different coefficients.","To calculate the true worth of a large stock position, you must account for both the market value and the impact of liquidity on your ability to sell the position. The market value is straightforward, calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the current stock price. However, for large positions, selling can significantly impact the stock price due to liquidity issues. Hence, you may need to apply a discount to the market value, known as the liquidity discount, which compensates for potential price depreciation upon selling the large block. This adjusted value, combining market value with a liquidity discount, offers a more realistic estimation of what the stock position is truly worth.",3
"$700 guaranteed to not be touched for 15 years+, should I put it anywhere other than a savings account?","Well, I understand this forum is about money but I think you would be far better off if you invest the money in your daughters education or something similar that can bring much more significant future gains. I am a big fan of compound interest and investing in stocks but $700 sitting until she's 21 wont grow into a significant amount. When she's 21, what would you ""hope"" she'd spend the money on? something valuable like education right? so why don't you take the first step now so she will get a much bigger return than the monitory value. If I were you I'd invest in a home library or something similar.","Given the long-term horizon of 15+ years, and assuming you're seeking better growth potential than a savings account typically offers, you should consider investing in a diversified portfolio, possibly in low-cost index funds or ETFs, which historically have delivered higher returns over such periods. This diversification can help manage risk while potentially providing a greater return than a savings account. Always keep in mind your own risk tolerance and the potential for market fluctuations. Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific goals and needs is also advisable.",1
What are the implications of a corporate stock repurchase or share buyback program?,"A board authorizes the repurchase of shares because they feel the stock in undervalued. The hope is that the stocks will rise either directly by their repurchase, or in the near term due to the realization that the company is in better shape then the market thought. Eventually those shares will be resold back into the market thus bring in more cash at a later date.  They will set limits on them maximum they will pay, they will also spread the repurchases out over a time period so they don't overwhelm the market.","A corporate stock repurchase, or share buyback program, typically signals the management's confidence in the company's financial health, suggesting they believe the stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, it can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and often boosts the stock price, benefiting shareholders. However, it also means the company is choosing to reinvest its cash in its own stock rather than in new projects, acquisitions, or debt reduction, which could signal a lack of profitable investment opportunities. Extensive buybacks may also artificially inflate stock prices, potentially leading to overvaluation.",1
How much time should be spent on Penny Stocks Trading a day?,"How long is a piece of string?  This will depend on many variables. How many trades will you make in a day? What income would you be expecting to make? What expectancy do you need to achieve? Which markets you will choose to trade?  Your first step should be to develop a Trading Plan, then develop your trading rules and your risk management. Then you should back test your strategy and then use a virtual account to practice losing on. Because one thing you will get is many losses. You have to learn to take a loss when the market moves against you. And you need to let your profits run and keep your losses small. A good book to start with is Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van Tharp. It will teach you about Expectancy, Money Management, Risk Management and the Phycology of Trading. Two thing I can recommend are: 1) to look into position and trend trading and other types of short term trading instead of day trading. You would usually place your trades after market close together with your stops and avoid being in front of the screen all day trying to chase the market. You need to take your emotion out of your trading if you want to succeed; 2) don't trade penny stocks, trade commodities, FX or standard stocks, but keep away from penny stocks. Just because you can buy them for a penny does not mean they are cheap.","The amount of time spent on penny stocks trading per day varies depending on your investing strategy, experience, and goals. For active traders seeking to capitalize on short-term fluctuations, several hours each day might be necessary for research, monitoring markets, and executing trades. Casual or part-time traders might spend far less time, perhaps an hour daily, to review their positions and make adjustments. Given the high risk and volatility associated with penny stocks, it's crucial to invest time in thorough research and continuous education, regardless of your trading intensity. Balance is key, ensuring enough time for informed decisions without overcommitting to potentially speculative investments.",1
Is short selling a good hedging strategy during overzealous market conditions?,"Short selling can be a good strategy to hedge, but you have almost unlimited downside.  If a stock price skyrockets, you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital. A smarter strategy to hedge, that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down.  Your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more. Another way to hedge is to SELL calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to.  You might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you didn't want to sell your shares right now.  That way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside, but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option. (You'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them, but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that).","Short selling can be a viable hedging strategy during overzealous market conditions because it allows investors to profit from declining stock prices, potentially offsetting losses in their long positions. However, it's essential to recognize that short selling entails significant risk, including the possibility of unlimited losses, since a stock's price can theoretically rise indefinitely. Additionally, this strategy requires precise timing and market analysis to be effective. Investors must carefully weigh these risks and consider their investment objectives and tolerance for risk before employing short selling as a hedging strategy.",1
How to decide on split between large/mid/small cap on 401(k) and how often rebalance,"It's a trade-off. The answer depends on your risk tolerance. Seeking higher rewards demands higher risk. If you want advice, I would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs. As a sample point, NOT necessarily right for anyone else...I'm considered an aggressive investor, and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks. I'm entirely in low-cost index funds, distributed as ... with the money tied up in a ""quiesced"" defined-contribution pension fund being treated as a low-yield bond. Some of these have beaten the indexes they're tracking, some haven't. My average yield since I started investing has been a bit over 10%/year (not including the company match on part of the 401k), which I consider Good Enough -- certainly good enough for something that requires near-zero attention from me. Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. This may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances. I'm posting it only as an example, NOT a recommendation.  Regarding when to rebalance: Set some threshhold at which things have drifted too far from your preferred distribution (value of a fund being 5% off its target percentage in the mix is one rule I've sometimes used), and/or pick some reasonable (usually fairly low) frequency at which you'll actively rebalance (once a year, 4x/year, whenever you change your car's oil, something like that), and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you're adding to the investments. Note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains, which is generally a good thing; you want as much of your profit to be long-term as possible, and to avoid triggering the ""wash sales"" rule. Generally, you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that I'd consider unreasonably risky, or unless you're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money.","Deciding on the split between large, mid, and small-cap investments in your 401(k) hinges on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives. Typically, a diversified approach is advisable, with heavier allocations to large caps for stability and smaller allocations to mid and small caps for growth potential. Consider a foundational split influenced by these factors, adjusting as your career and financial goals evolve. Rebalancing should be a periodic exercise, at least annually or after significant market movements, to ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your targeted asset allocation and risk profile, maintaining the strategic equilibrium between these segments.",1
Buying from an aggressive salesperson,I often spend weeks or months (and sometimes even years) deciding whether to buy something. Certainly the dealer should recognize you by now if you take a third opportunity to look at the same instrument. You could politely remind him that you've twice declined his excellent prices. From there you can assert that you will purchase only when you are ready.,"Navigating engagements with aggressive salespeople requires a balance of assertiveness and clear communication. Begin by setting firm boundaries, confidently stating your needs and limitations. It's crucial to conduct your own research beforehand to understand the product and its alternatives, ensuring you are not swayed by high-pressure tactics. Politely but firmly decline offers that don't align with your financial goals or if you require more time to think. Remember, it’s okay to walk away without making a decision on the spot. Your primary aim is to protect your financial well-being, not to appease a salesperson.",1
What are some signs that the stock market might crash?,"There are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles, such as interest rates rising. However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the S&P500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low. If you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well. The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares. You can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too. If you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index, this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares. You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again. Will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again, yes there might be, but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market, and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made. But remember no one ever went broke making a profit. The most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital. I would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50% or more, then take 5 years or more to recover. And remember, paying tax is a good thing, it means you made money. If you don't want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits, because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day.","Signs that the stock market might crash include extreme valuations with significantly high price-to-earnings ratios, speculative investment behavior with a surge in risky and unchecked investments, a rapid increase in interest rates making borrowing more expensive for companies and consumers, geopolitical tensions or economic sanctions that can disrupt global supply chains and investor confidence, and over-leveraging by both consumers and corporations leading to unsustainable debt levels. Additionally, inversion of the yield curve, where short-term debt instruments have higher yields than long-term ones, often signals investor pessimism about the near-term economy, acting as a historical precursor to market downturns.",1
Recent college grad. Down payment on a house or car?,"Buy a car. Unless you definitely know you are living in the area for a good long time, avoid buying a house and get a car instead.","As a recent college graduate, prioritizing a down payment on a house over a car can be more beneficial in the long term. Real estate typically appreciates in value, potentially offering equity growth and stability. In contrast, a car is a depreciating asset that loses value quickly. However, consider your lifestyle needs, job location, public transportation options, and financial readiness, including debt levels and emergency savings. If housing prices are high or you value mobility, leasing a car or buying a reliable used vehicle might be sensible. Focus on investments that align with your long-term financial goals and personal circumstances.",1
401k with paltry match or SPY ETF?,"I think you understood much of what I say, in general. Unfortunately, I didn't follow Patches math.  What I gleen from your summary is a 1% match to the 10% invested, but a .8% expense. The ETF VOO has a .05% annual fee, a bit better than SPY.  A quick few calculations show that the 10% bonus does offset a long run of the .75% excess expense compared to external investing. After decades, the 401(k) appears to still be a bit ahead. Not the dramatic delta suggested in the prior answer, but enough to stay with the 401(k) in this situation. The tiny match still makes the difference. Edit - the question you linked to. The 401(k) had no match, and an awful 1.2% annual expense. This combination is deadly for the younger investor. Always an exception to offer - a 25% marginal rate earner close to retiring at 15%. The 401(k) deposit saves him 25, but can soon be withdrawn at 15, it's worth a a few years of that fee to make this happen. For the young person who is planning a quick exit from the company, same deal.","Choosing between contributing to a 401(k) with a paltry match and investing in an SPY ETF depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the specifics of the 401(k) plan. If the 401(k) offers any match, it's often advisable to contribute enough to receive the full match, as it represents an immediate, guaranteed return on your contributions, essentially free money. Beyond the match, investing in an SPY ETF can offer more flexibility and potentially higher returns but lacks the tax advantages of pre-tax 401(k) contributions. Consider a balanced approach: maximize the employer match, then allocate additional investments according to your retirement strategy and risk profile.",1

Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?,"Any person at any time may produce their own currency, one can even do so on the back of a paper napkin, ripped beer coaster or whatever.  This is NOT a banking privilege, it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce. It is called a 'negotiable instrument' ... it gives the holder rights to a sum of money.  Notice that I say 'holder' ... this is what distinguishes it from a non-negotiable instrument, the fact that you don't need to redeem it from source, you can pass it to another who then becomes the 'holder in due course' and thus obtains the rights conferred. The conferable rights over a sum of money (or, indeed, other asset) are themselves 'value' Do banks do this ?  Yes, all the time! ... one of the simplest examples are cheques drawn against the bank, which are considered 'as good as cash'.  Usually they will be drawn out to the order of the person you wish to pay ... but can equally be drawn out to bearer.  The only reasons they resist making out to bearer is : But you can write your own at 'any time' on 'any thing' ... See the apocryphal, yet deliciously entertaining, tale of the 'negotiable cow'","Banks don't print their own paper money because the issuance of currency is a centralized function managed by a country's central bank or monetary authority. This centralization ensures consistency, stability, and trust in the currency, preventing inflation and maintaining economic balance. Central banks determine the volume of money in circulation based on economic indicators, striving to support economic growth while preventing inflation. Allowing individual banks to print money would lead to an uncontrollable increase in the money supply, potentially causing hyperinflation, devaluing the currency, and undermining the overall economic system.",1
"Pros & cons in Hungary of investing retirement savings exclusively in silver? What better alternatives, given my concerns?","This sound like a very bad idea. If you invest exclusively in silver, your investment is not diversified in any way. This is what I would call risky. Have a look at index funds and ETFs and build a diversified portfolio. It does not take much time, and you don't need to let it do by someone else. They are risky too, but I see ""silver only"" as much riskier. You reduce the risk by holding on to the funds for a long time.","Investing retirement savings exclusively in silver in Hungary—or anywhere—presents pros such as hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, and silver being tangible with industrial value. However, the cons include silver's price volatility, lack of yield or dividends, storage costs and security concerns, and potential difficulties in liquidation. Diversification is key in investment strategy to mitigate risks and enhance returns. Considering your concerns, better alternatives might include a mix of asset classes such as equities, bonds, real estate, and perhaps a smaller allocation to precious metals like silver to balance risk and potential rewards, ensuring a more stable and robust retirement portfolio.",1
Is there any circumstance in which it is necessary to mark extra payments on a loan as going to “principal and not interest”?,"It could be a couple of things besides extra principal: I seem to remember hearing that some (shady?) lenders would just pocket extra payments if you didn't specify where they were headed, but I've also been told that this just isn't true.","In the context of loan repayments, specifically designating extra payments to go toward the principal rather than interest can be essential in specific circumstances, particularly for loans with higher interest rates or pre-calculated interest (like some auto loans or mortgages). This strategic approach ensures that any additional payments directly reduce the loan's principal balance, thereby decreasing the overall interest paid over the life of the loan. It accelerates the payoff timeline, potentially saving substantial money on interest charges. However, it's crucial to communicate with the lender directly to ensure these extra payments are processed according to your wishes, as some loans have pre-set terms for how extra payments are applied.",1
Automatic investments for cheap,"For your purposes, I would recommend using direct investment in a no-load mutual fund.  I mostly use Vanguard and would recommend them.  They just about invented index funds, usually have the lowest (internal) expenses for index and many other funds, if you take electronic instead of paper statements there is no maintenance fee, have no transaction commission, can do periodic automatic investment from a bank account etc.  A typical index fund there would require an initial $3000 investment and would have a minimum of $100 for each additional investment.  If you can't come up with an initial sum of that size, you might be able to find a broker with a lower minimum and suitable free ETFs trades as others have suggested.","Automating investments is a cost-effective strategy that streamlines wealth accumulation without the burden of constant oversight. By setting up regular, automatic transfers to investment accounts, you can take advantage of dollar-cost averaging, mitigating market timing risk. Opting for low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within these automated investments maximizes your returns by minimizing fees. Furthermore, many platforms offer automatic investment options with no transaction fees, ensuring even greater savings. This hands-off approach not only simplifies the investment process but also harnesses the power of compounding interest over time, amplifying your wealth-building potential.",1
Do other countries have the equivalent of Australia's Negative Gearing?,"In India, where I live, you can: In addition, housing loans are given priority status as well - bank capital requirements on housing loans is lower than for, say, a corporate loan or a loan against other kinds of collateral. That makes housing loans cheaper as well - you get a home loan at around 10% in India versus 15% against most other assets, and since you can deduct it against tax, the effective interest rate is even lower.  Housing in India is unaffordable too, if you're wondering. In a suburb 40 Km away from Delhi, a 2000 sq. foot apartment, about 1500 sq. ft. of carpet area, with no appliances costs about USD 250,000.","Yes, other countries have concepts equivalent to Australia’s Negative Gearing, albeit under different regulations and names. For example, in the United States, investors can deduct real estate losses from their taxable income, similar to negative gearing, under certain conditions. The UK also allows landlords to offset mortgage interest against rental income, although recent changes have modified how these deductions work. Canada permits the deduction of interest on money borrowed for investment purposes, provided it's expected to generate income. Each country's tax code uniquely addresses the principle behind negative gearing, with variations in application and limitations.",2
Is it possible to influence a company's actions by buying stock?,"Another form of 'shareholder' activism. You might be able to buy a single share, which it seems would cost around $35, attend the AGM, and ask questions and/or shout or sing and delay proceedings. There would certainly be security guards or police ready to remove protesters at an AGM.","Yes, buying stock can give you a platform to influence a company’s actions, but the level of influence largely depends on the amount of stock you own. Small investors may have a limited voice, typically exercised through voting on company matters at shareholder meetings. However, large shareholders or institutional investors can wield considerable influence, sometimes directly engaging with company management or sitting on the board of directors. This influence can be used to sway company policies, strategic directions, and corporate governance practices. Nonetheless, influencing a company requires a significant stake, which might be beyond the reach of average individual investors.",1
Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?,"Like all other loan-vs-savings questions, it depends on the terms of the loan. If you have a choice, the usual answer is to pay off the loan with the worst terms (which usually means the highest interest rate) first, and only start with savings when you've paid off all the high-interest loans entirely. If your student loan is on US terms, then pay it off as soon as you can, unless you have commercial debt (credit-card or unsecured personal loan), which you should pay off first, or unless you have or are realistically likely to get eligibility for a forgiveness program. But it does depends on the terms of the debt, which in turn depend on the country you studied in; on UK terms it's a very bad idea to pay off a student loan any faster than you have to.  Interest is restricted to the rate of inflation, so good investments probably beat the interest rate of the student loan; the required repayments vary with your income, so savings are more useful than debt repayment if you encounter income difficulties (e.g unemployment) in the future, and finally the debt is automatically forgiven after 30 years, so you may never have to pay it all back anyway - so why pay it off voluntarily if it would get forgiven eventually anyway?","Keeping student debt, rather than paying it off quickly, can be advisable for several reasons. If the debt carries low interest rates, it might be financially beneficial to invest money that would have been used for early repayment into higher-yielding investments, thus potentially earning more over time than the cost of the interest on the debt. Additionally, maintaining student loans can positively impact credit scores by demonstrating a history of regular, on-time payments. Federal student loans also offer flexible repayment plans and forgiveness programs that might not be fully leveraged if the debt is paid off prematurely.",2
"Should I sell my stocks when the stock hits a 52-week high in order to “Buy Low, Sell High”?","Though it seems unintuitive, you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock (including the fact that it's at its 52-week high) and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward.  If you think it's going to go up even further,  more than the return on your other options for where to put the money, keep the stock.  If you think it's peaked and will be going down, now's a good time to sell. To put it another way: if you didn't already have this stock, would you buy it today? Your choice is just about the same: you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares, OR the shares.   Which do you think is worth more? You also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio.  Some are probably a larger percentage than others, and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio.  It may be time to do some rebalancing, which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large (as a % of your portfolio) and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you're not as invested in as you would like to be.  This might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio. If part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional, not purely financial, you could sell now, mark it as a ""win,"" and move on to another opportunity.  Trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance, but not everybody is into trading or money for money's sake.  What's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life?  If holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down, and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more (e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place), you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns (from emotion-based trading) is acceptable.  As CQM points out, you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires/expires; the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls.","Selling stocks solely because they've hit a 52-week high can overlook the broader context of their potential future performance and the fundamentals driving their prices. ""Buy low, sell high"" is a general strategy, but it's more nuanced in practice. A stock at its 52-week high could still offer significant growth prospects, driven by strong company fundamentals or industry trends. Instead, evaluate the reasons behind the stock's performance, its valuation in comparison to its peers, and future growth potential. Decisions should be grounded in thorough analysis rather than arbitrary price thresholds. Diversification and a long-term perspective often yield better results than trying to time market highs and lows.",1
Why would this kind of penny stock increase so much in value?,"Disregarding the particular example and focusing on the actual questions: YES, definitely, the whole concept of ""pump and dump scheme"" refers to the many cases when this was intentionally done; Everything has a limit, but the limit can be quite high, especially if starting from a low value (a penny stock) and if the stock is low volume, then inflating ten or hundred times over a real value may be possible; and any value might be infinitely times overvalued for a company that turns out to have a value of zero. Yes, unless it's done very blatantly, you should expect that the ""inflator"" has much more experience in hiding the signs of inflation than the skill of average investor to notice them.","Penny stocks can experience significant increases in value due to a variety of factors, such as successful clinical trials for biotech companies, the discovery of valuable resources for mining companies, or securing lucrative contracts for technology firms. Additionally, market speculation, news releases, and social media hype can lead to rapid price movements. However, the low price and market capitalization of penny stocks make them susceptible to manipulation and high volatility. It's crucial to perform diligent research and understand the inherent risks before investing in these types of stocks.",1
2,"The actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage, because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis (both technical and fundamental), and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at. A change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time, and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period. I think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities.  For example: $1.00 rise in a $2.00 stock representing a 50% increase in price; $1.00 rise in a $10.00 stock representing a 10% increase in price. On a standard chart both of these look the same, as they both show a $1.00 increase in price. So what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price? It is actually quite simple. You view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale (most charting packages should have this option). What may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart, looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price. Example of Standard Price Scale VS LOG Price Scale on a Chart Standard Price Scale  On the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from Mar09 to Jan12 and then the price seems to zoom up after Jan12 to Mar13. This is because a 4% increase (for example) of $0.50 is only $0.02, whilst a 4% increase of $7.00 $0.28, so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart. LOG Price Scale  On the LOG chart however, these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at. This thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling, or the size of the change in price.","Using percent change instead of price graphs provides a more standardized way to assess the performance of different investments, especially over time. Price graphs show the nominal price changes, which can be misleading when comparing assets of different values. Percent change, on the other hand, illustrates how much an investment has grown or declined relative to its starting point, offering a clearer picture of its relative performance. This approach normalizes the data, allowing for more straightforward comparisons across different assets or markets, regardless of their initial price levels, making it a valuable tool for investors in evaluating the effectiveness of their portfolios.",2
How much money should I put on a house?,"Before doing anything else: you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning, to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves. Seriously, you'll both be safer and happier if it's all explicit. How much you should put on the house is not the right question. Houses don't sell instantly, and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange. You need to have enough operating capital for normal finances, plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses. There are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions. After that, the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all. It isn't always a better option than renting and (again as discussed in answers to other questions) there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance. If you're just thinking about the financials, it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market. The time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income, plan not to move for at least five years, really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs (which will absorb more money)...  As far as how much to put down vs. finance: you really want a down payment of at least 20%. Anything less than that, and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance, which is a significant expense. Whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get (this is a good time in that regard) versus how much return you are getting on your investments, combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you're comfortable committing to. If you've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you, putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing... IF you're comfortable with that. If the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable,  this might not be a good answer for you. It's a judgement call. I waited until i'd been in out of school about 25 years before I was ready to buy a house. Since i'd been careful with my money over that time,  I had enough in investments that I could have bought the house for cash. Or I could have gone the other way and financed 80% of it for maximum leverage. I decided that what I was comfortable with was financing 50%. You'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with. But I say again, if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved. It may be absolutely the right thing to do ... but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out... and you'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills. (Being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights... but even then it's safer to make it all explicit.) Edit: Yes, making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan. You'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you, or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you.","The amount of money you should put on a house mainly depends on your financial situation, including your income, expenses, savings, and investment strategy. A common rule of thumb is the 28/36 rule, which suggests that no more than 28% of your gross monthly income should go towards housing expenses, and not more than 36% should go toward total debt service, including your mortgage. It’s also wise to aim for a down payment of at least 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) and secure lower mortgage rates, but this can vary based on market conditions and the specific loan programs available to you.",2

"High credit utilization, some high interest - but credit score not overly bad. How to attack debt in this situation?","You need to pay off the entire balance of 7450 as soon as possible. This should be your primary financial goal at this point above anything else. A basic structure that you can follow is this: Is the £1500 balance with the 39.9% interest rate the obvious starting point here? Yes, that is fine. But all the cards and overdraft debts need to be treated with the same urgency! What are the prospects for improving my credit score in say the next 6-12 months enough to get a 0% balance transfer or loan for consolidation? This should not be a primary concern of yours if you want to move on with your financial life. Debt consolidation will not help you achieve the goals you have described (home ownership, financial stability). If you follow the advice here, by the time you get to the point of being eligible, you may not see enough savings in interest to make it worth the hassle. Focus on the hard stuff and pay off the balances. Is that realistic, or am I looking at a longer term struggle? You are looking at a significant struggle. If it was easy you would not be asking this question! The length of time will be determined by your choices: how aggressively you will cut your lifestyle, take on extra jobs, and place additional payments on your debt.  By being that extreme, you will actually start to see progress, which will be encouraging. If you go in half-committed, your progress will show as much and it will be demotivating. Much of your success will hinge on your mental and emotional toughness to push through the hard work of delaying pleasure and paying off these balances. That is just my personal experience, so you can take it or leave it. :) The credit score will take care of itself if you follow this method, so don't worry about it. Good Luck!","In addressing high credit utilization and elevated interest rates, despite a relatively solid credit score, prioritizing debt repayment is key. Initially, target high-interest debts (commonly credit cards) using the avalanche method, whereby extra payments are directed towards the highest interest-bearing account first while maintaining minimum payments on others. This method reduces overall interest costs. Concurrently, consider balance transfer options to lower interest cards or secure a consolidation loan at a lower rate, if feasible, to streamline payments and reduce interest expenses. Regularly reassess your budget to find additional savings for debt repayment, and avoid accruing new debt to maintain progress.",1
Why do credit cards require a minimum annual household income?,"Here's one reason that's being overlooked in answers so far. (@ChrisInEdmonton, this is for your comment on @Chad's answer.) How do credit card companies make money? Sure, there's interest charges, but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money, and by people defaulting on their debt / entering bankruptcy. The other way they make money is by processing transactions. They get a cut of whatever you buy. If you're a high-income person, and you're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card, your business is worth more. They will be willing to bribe you with things like cash-back, frequent flier miles, and insurance on your auto rentals, so that they can be your #1 go-to card.  (This works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall - American Express - get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers' wallets. But that was mentioned in other answers.) If you're not a high-income person, your business is worth less. If you go somewhere asking for credit, they're going to try and give you a card which will earn them the most money - which probably isn't the one where they give you back 50% of their transaction fee in rewards. It's a calculated risk, since they still have to compete against cash, debit cards, and all the other credit card companies, so they don't have you totally over a barrel, but you shouldn't expect as many freebies, either.","Credit card issuers require a minimum annual household income to ensure that applicants possess the financial means to manage credit responsibly. This criterion helps in assessing the risk profile of potential cardholders by gauging their ability to repay borrowed amounts. By establishing a minimum income requirement, issuers aim to mitigate the risk of default, ensuring that credit is extended to individuals who are more likely to manage their debt effectively. This practice not only protects the financial institutions but also helps in safeguarding consumers from potentially overextending their credit and facing financial difficulties.",2
selling apple stock limit order,"Your order may or may not be executed.  The price of stock can open anywhere.  Often yesterday's close is a good indication of today's open, but with a big event overnight, the open may be somewhere quite different.  You'll have to wait and see like the rest of us.  Also, even if it doesn't execute at the open, the price could vary during the day and it might execute later.","Placing a limit order to sell Apple stock means you're instructing your broker to only execute the sale at a specific price or higher. This strategy gives you control over the minimum price you're willing to accept, preventing your stock from being sold at a lower rate. It's particularly useful in volatile markets or if you have a target return in mind. However, it's important to remember that if the stock doesn't reach your specified price, the order may not be executed, potentially missing out on market opportunities.",1
How do I get rid of worthless penny stocks if there is no volume (so market/limit orders don't work) and my broker won't buy them from me?,"Merrill charges $500 flat fee to (I assume purchase) my untraded or worthless security. In my case, it's an OTC stock whose management used for a microcap scam, which resulted in a class action lawsuit, etc. but the company is still listed on OTC and I'm stuck with 1000s of shares. (No idea about the court decision)","If you find yourself holding penny stocks that you cannot sell due to lack of volume and your broker won't buy them back, consider a few options. First, check if another trading platform or broker might have more liquidity for those stocks. Sometimes, transferring your holdings might help. Second, explore if the company offers a direct buyback program. Lastly, consider the shares as a potential tax write-off by consulting with a tax advisor. This could mitigate financial loss by reducing your taxable income, though it's imperative to ensure compliance with tax laws specific to your jurisdiction.",1
Why is day trading considered riskier than long-term trading?,"In day trading, you're trying to predict the immediate fluctuations of an essentially random system.  In long-term investing, you're trying to assess the strength of a company over a period of time. You also have frequent opportunities to assess your position and either add to it or get out.","Day trading is considered riskier than long-term trading primarily due to its reliance on short-term market fluctuations, which are unpredictable and can result in significant losses within a very short timeframe. Unlike long-term trading, where investors can wait out periods of volatility, day traders must constantly monitor the market, making decisions quickly, often without the benefit of thorough research. This high-frequency trading amplifies the risk of substantial financial loss due to both the volatility of the market and the potential for emotional decision-making, leading to poorly timed trades based on short-term market movements rather than fundamental long-term value.",1
Why would you elect to apply a refund to next year's tax bill?,"The refund may offset your liability for the next year, especially if you are a Schedule ""C"" filer.  By having your refund applied to the coming year's taxes you are building a 'protection' against a potentially high liability if you were planning to sell a building that was a commercial building and would have Capital Gains. Or you sold stock at a profit that would also put you in the Capital Gain area.  You won a large sum in a lottery, the refund could cushion a bit of the tax. In short, if you think you will have a tax liability in the current year then on the tax return you are filing for the year that just past, it may be to your benefit to apply the refund.  If you owe money  from a prior year, the refund will not be sent to you so you will not be able to roll it forward.    One specific example is you did qualify in the prior year for the ACA.  If in the year you are currently in- before you file your taxes-- you realize that you will have to pay at the end of the current year, then assigning your refund will pay part or all of the liability. Keep in mind that the 'tax' imposed due to ACA is only collected from your refunds.  If you keep having a liability to pay  or have no refunds due to you, the liability is not collected from you.","Electing to apply a tax refund to next year's tax bill can be a strategic decision for those expecting a higher tax liability in the following year, perhaps due to increased income or lower deductions. This approach can act as a prepayment, potentially reducing the need for estimated tax payments or avoiding underpayment penalties. It can also serve as a form of forced savings, ensuring the refund money is set aside for tax obligations rather than spent impulsively. For individuals with fluctuating incomes, this can provide a smoother financial planning horizon by aligning expected tax liabilities with prepayments.",2
Can individuals day-trade stocks using High-Frequency Trading (HFT)?,"I just finished a high frequency trading project. Individuals can do it, but you need a lot of capital. You can get a managed server in Times Square for $1500/month, giving you access to 90% of the US exchanges that matter, their data farms are within 3 milliseconds of distance (latency). You can also get more servers in the same building as the exchanges, if you know where to look ;) thats all I can divulge good luck","While technically possible, individuals day-trading stocks using High-Frequency Trading (HFT) strategies face significant challenges. HFT requires sophisticated algorithms, ultra-low latency data feeds, and the ability to execute orders at extremely fast speeds, often measured in microseconds. These capabilities demand substantial financial resources for advanced technology and infrastructure, typically beyond the reach of individual traders. Furthermore, HFT involves competing against well-funded institutional players and professional trading firms that dominate this space. Therefore, while not impossible, successful individual HFT is highly unlikely and would require resources and expertise that are generally inaccessible to the average retail investor.",2
Does the profit of a company directly affect its stock or indirectly by causing people to buy or sell?,"people implicity agree to sell stocks when a company does bad But, remember, when you sell the stock of a company that, in your estimation, 'did bad', someone else had to buy; otherwise, there is no sale. The someone else who bought your shares evidently disagrees with your assessment. Did you sell because the company didn't earn a profit at all? Did it not earn a profit because it's in a dead-end business that is slowly but inevitably declining to zero? Something like Sears Holdings? Or did it not make a profit because it is in an emerging market that will possibly someday become hugely profitable? Something like Tesla, Inc.? Did you sell because the company made a profit, but it was lower than expected? Did they make a lower-than-expected profit because of lower sales? Why were the sales lower? Is the industry declining? Was the snow too heavy to send the construction crews out? Did the company make a big investment to build a new plant that will, in a few years, yield even higher sales and profits? What are the profits year-over-year? Increasing? Declining? Usually, investors are willing to pay a premium, that is more than expected, for a stock in a company with robust growth.  As you can see, the mere fact that a company reported a profit is only one of many factors that determine the price of the shares in the market.","The profit of a company affects its stock price both directly and indirectly. Directly, because profit numbers are key indicators of a company's performance and help investors assess its valuation. When a company reports higher profits, it is often perceived as more valuable, potentially leading to a stock price increase. Indirectly, these profit reports influence investor sentiment, causing people to buy or sell shares based on their expectations for the company's future performance. Therefore, while the profit itself is a fundamental factor, the market's reaction to this information through buying and selling behavior also significantly impacts the stock price.",2
Does a stock holder profit from a reverse-stock split?,"If I held stock in these companies yesterday, would I have profited by these gains? No.  For DZSI, your 5 shares at $1.10 would now be 1 share at $5.50, so you would have the same total amount.  For SGY, they closed at $6.95, and opened at $32.80, so your five shares at $6.95 would now be one share at $32.80, so you would have actually lost money (not purely because of the split, but because the ""new"" shares are trading lower then the expected 1:5 split price).  A split in general does not affect market cap (how much your total shares are worth) but there may be residual effects that cause the market value to fluctuate after a split that affect the price.","A reverse stock split itself does not inherently provide profit to the stockholder. It consolidates the number of existing shares into fewer, proportionally more valuable shares, without directly affecting the company's overall market value. Following the split, while each share represents a larger ownership slice of the company and is priced higher, the stockholder owns fewer shares. The real value of the stockholder's investment remains the same, minus any market perception or psychological impacts that might influence the stock price post-split. Therefore, the immediate financial gain from a reverse stock split is neutral, with any profit depending on subsequent share price movements.",1
How would bonds fare if interest rates rose?,"1. Interest rates What you should know is that the longer the ""term"" of a bond fund, the more it will be affected by interest rates. So a short-term bond fund will not be subject to large gains or losses due to rate changes, an intermediate-term bond fund will be subject to moderate gains or losses, and a long-term bond fund will be subject to the largest gains or losses. When a book or financial planner says to buy ""bonds"" with no other qualification, they almost always mean investment-grade intermediate-term bond funds (or for individual bonds, the equivalent would be a bond ladder averaging an intermediate term). If you want technical details, look at the ""average duration"" or ""average maturity"" of the bond fund; as a rough guide, if the duration is 10, then a 1% change in interest rates would be a 10% gain or loss on the fund. Another thing you can do is look at long-term (10 years or ideally longer) performance history on some short, intermediate, and long term bond index funds, and you can see how the long term funds bounced around more. Non-investment-grade bonds (aka junk bonds or high yield bonds) are more affected by factors other than interest rates, including some of the same factors (economic booms or recessions) that affect stocks. As a result, they aren't as good for diversifying a portfolio that otherwise consists of stocks. (Having stocks, investment grade bonds, and also a little bit in high-yield bonds can add diversification, though. Just don't replace your bond allocation with high-yield bonds.) A variety of ""complicated"" bonds exist (convertible bonds are an example) and these are tough to analyze. There are also ""floating rate"" bonds (bank loan funds), these have minimal interest rate sensitivity because the rate goes up to offset rate rises. These funds still have credit risks, in the credit crisis some of them lost a lot of money. 2. Diversification The purpose of diversification is risk control. Your non-bond funds will outperform in many years, but in other years (say the -37% S&P 500 drop in 2008) they may not. You will not know in advance which year you'll get. You get risk control in at least a few ways. There's also an academic Modern Portfolio Theory explanation for why you should diversify among risky assets (aka stocks), something like: for a given desired risk/return ratio, it's better to leverage up a diverse portfolio than to use a non-diverse portfolio, because risk that can be eliminated through diversification is not compensated by increased returns. The theory also goes that you should choose your diversification between risk assets and the risk-free asset according to your risk tolerance (i.e. select the highest return with tolerable risk). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory for excruciating detail. The translation of the MPT stuff to practical steps is typically, put as much in stock index funds as you can tolerate over your time horizon, and put the rest in (intermediate-term investment-grade) bond index funds. That's probably what your planner is asking you to do. My personal view, which is not the standard view, is that you should take as much risk as you need to take, not as much as you think you can tolerate: http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ But almost everyone else will say to do the 80/20 if you have decades to retirement and feel you can tolerate the risk, so my view that 60/40 is the max desirable allocation to stocks is not mainstream. Your planner's 80/20 advice is the standard advice. Before doing 100% stocks I'd give you at least a couple cautions: See also:","If interest rates were to rise, the prevailing prices of existing bonds, which have fixed interest rates, would generally decrease. This inverse relationship occurs because newer bonds would likely be issued with higher interest rates to reflect the current market, making the older, lower-yielding bonds less attractive. Consequently, investors looking to buy bonds on the secondary market would demand a discount on the older bonds, leading to a decrease in their market value. However, for bondholders who hold their bonds to maturity, the impact of rising interest rates is typically limited to opportunity cost rather than an actual reduction in the bond's face value or its interest payments.",1
What implications does having the highest household debt to disposable income ratio have on Australia?,"It is basically the same situation what US was when the crash happened. People took on debt without the means to pay, even with awful credit records. But the problem isn't the debt people take on themselves, but with the limited disposable income they have how efficiently can their debts be serviced. And how do banks who lend out money can recover their money. When banks lend money to all and sundry, they have to take care of defaults and that is when financial wizardry comes into play. In US people have the option to default on their debt and refinance it, so banks assumed default and tried to hedge their risks. If this is an option in Australia, be ready for a crash else not to worry about much. If banks continue lending expect higher inflation rates, higher interest rates and maybe a downgrade of bonds issued by the Australian government. Higher import costs and a boom in exports because of devalued Australian dollar.","Australia's exceedingly high household debt to disposable income ratio has profound implications for both the country's economy and individual financial health. Elevated debt levels increase the vulnerability of households to economic shocks, such as interest rate rises or unemployment, potentially leading to higher default rates. This scenario could then precipitate a broader economic downturn if widespread. Additionally, high debt obligations restrict consumer spending, pivotal for economic growth, by diverting income from goods and services to debt servicing. This paradoxically could dampen economic activity, affecting job creation and income growth, thereby creating a cycle that’s challenging to break free from.",3
why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments?,"Given that the 6 answers all advocate similar information, let me offer you the alternate scenario - You earn $60K and have an employer offering a 50% match on all deposits. All deposits. (Note, I recently read a Q&A here describing such an offer. If I see it again, I'll link).  Let the thought of the above settle in. You think about the fact that $42K isn't a bad salary, and decide to deposit 30%, to gain the full match on your $18K deposit. Now, you budget to live your life, pay your bills, etc, but it's tight. When you accumulate $2000, and a strong want comes up (a toy, a trip, anything, no judgement) you have a tough decision. You think to yourself, ""after the match, I am literally saving 45% of my income. I'm on a pace to have the ability to retire in 20 years. Why do I need to save even more?""  Your budget has enough discretionary spending that if you have a $2000 'emergency', you charge it and pay it off over the next 6-8 months. Much larger, and you know that your super-funded 401(k) has the ability to tap a loan. Your choice to turn away from the common wisdom has the recommended $20K (about 6 months of your spending) sitting in your 401(k), pretax deposited as $26K, and matched to nearly $40K, growing long term.  Note: This is a devil's advocate answer. Had I been the first to answer, it would reflect the above.  In my own experience, when I got married, we built up the proper emergency fund. As interest rates fell, we looked at our mortgage balance, and agreed that paying down the loan would enable us to refinance and save enough in mortgage interest that the net effect was as if we were getting 8% on the money. At the same time as we got that new mortgage, the bank offered a HELOC, which I never needed to use. Did we somehow create high risk? Perhaps. Given that my wife and I were both still working, and had similar incomes, it seemed reasonable.","An emergency fund is crucial even if you have investments because it provides financial security during unforeseen circumstances without the need to liquidate your investments, potentially at a loss or during unfavorable market conditions. This fund acts as a buffer, ensuring that your investment strategy remains intact for long-term goals. It covers urgent expenses such as medical bills, home repairs, or job loss, allowing your investments to continue compounding, unhindered by short-term volatility or liquidity needs. Essentially, it separates your immediate financial needs from your long-term financial growth strategy, offering peace of mind and financial stability.",1
Is it a good practice to keep salary account and savings account separate?,"I pretty much only use my checking. What's the downside? Checking accounts don't pay as much interest as savings account. Oh, but wait, interest rates have been zero for nearly 10 years. So there is very little benefit to keeping money in my savings account. In fact, I had two savings accounts, and Well Fargo closed one of them because I hadn't used it in years. Downsides of savings accounts: You are limited to 5 transfers per month into or out of them. No such limit with checking. Upsides of savings accounts: Well, maybe you will be less likely to spend the money. Why don't you just have your pay go into your checking and then just transfer ""extra money"" out of it, rather than the reverse? If you want to put money ""away"" so that you save it, assuming you're in the U.S.A., open a traditional IRA. Max deposit of $5500/year, and it reduces your taxable income. It's not a bad idea to have a separate account that you don't touch except for in an emergency. But, for me, the direction of flow is from work, to checking, to savings.","Yes, keeping your salary account separate from your savings account is a good practice. This separation can help you manage your finances better by clearly distinguishing between your monthly income and your savings. It encourages discipline in saving, making it less likely for you to spend your savings impulsively. Additionally, it simplifies tracking your expenses and savings growth. Many savings accounts offer higher interest rates or benefits like no minimum balance requirement when you maintain a certain balance, which can further incentivize saving. Moreover, it provides an added layer of security against fraud and unauthorized transactions.",3
Why does it seem unnecessary to fully save for irregular periodic expenses?,"It totally depends on when your expenses hit and whether you might have a larger stock than necessary. If you run your projections against the monthly save and the intervals of when you'll need the money, you might be able to extract some stock from the account.  I recommend making this a bit simpler. I operate this with an ""annuals"" account which is a complete aggregate of expenses that I know I have several times per year (or once every two years), but are not monthly or part of a weekly non-fixed expense budget cap. Instead of tracking each expense individually and saving for it, create a spreadsheet that lists out all of these expenses, sum them, and then divide by 12. When I first opened this account, I added a one-time deposit to ""catchup"" to make sure I would never need to pull money from another source for these expenses. As new expenses come into existence that I should plan for annually, I simply add them to this list and adjust the monthly auto-deposit to the account. This also adjusts my single number weekly budget.  To make it easy, whenever I see an expense on my annuals list on my amex or debit, I simply initiate a withdrawal from the annuals savings and it will balance out my weekly or monthly budget expenses.  The goal of my annuals account is to simply avoid anti-windfalls that are known quantities (insurance, annual eye exam, sprinkler flush, amazon prime, etc) that would throw a wrench in weekly/monthly budget and expense planning. The more variables you can remove from your weekly/monthly, the more regular it becomes and the more likely you will be able to stick to a budget.","It may seem unnecessary to fully save for irregular periodic expenses because many people prefer to rely on cash flow management and credit to handle such costs. By using a combination of monthly savings, credit, and adjustments in spending, individuals can manage these expenses without having the full amount saved upfront. This approach allows for greater flexibility in managing finances, leveraging the ability to adjust other spending habits or use credit facilities as a temporary measure, rather than locking away significant amounts of money in savings for each potential expense, which could be utilized or invested elsewhere for growth.",2
Why do some stocks have a higher margin requirement?,"It is a question of how volatile the stock is perceived to be, its beta correlation to the S&P500 or other index. Margin requirements are derived from the Federal Reserve, Self Regulatory Organizations, the exchange itself, the broker you use, and which margining system you are using. So that makes this a loaded question. There are at least three margin systems, before you have your own risk officer in a glass room that doesn't care how leveraged up you get. Brokers primarily don't want to lose money.","Stocks with higher margin requirements are often viewed by brokers and regulatory bodies as more volatile or riskier investments. This higher requirement is a protective measure to mitigate potential losses that might occur due to the stock's price fluctuations. Essentially, by requiring investors to put up more collateral, either in cash or securities, brokers ensure that there is enough equity in the account to withstand a significant drop in the stock's value without necessitating a margin call. This practice shields both the investor and the brokerage from the heightened risks associated with trading more volatile or less liquid stocks.",2
Do I have to pay taxes on income from my website or profits?,"Being a tax professional, my understanding is that the threshold limit is a single limit for all your source(s) of income. Now many people who already draw salary which is liable to tax, develop application for mobile and generate some income. Such income is liable to tax, if along with other income they exceed the threshold limit.  Income will have surely related expenses. And the expenses which are related to earning of the income are allowed to be deducted.","Yes, you are required to pay taxes on income generated from your website or any profits you earn online. This income is considered taxable by the IRS and most other tax authorities worldwide, irrespective of whether it's from selling goods, services, advertising space, or subscriptions. It should be reported as part of your annual income. The specific tax rate and reporting requirements can vary depending on the legal structure of your business (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, etc.) and your location. It’s crucial to maintain accurate financial records and possibly consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and optimize tax obligations.",2
Is it better to buy US stocks on US stock exchanges as a European?,Liquidity on dual listed equities is rarely the same on both exchanges. More liquidity means you would typically get a better price assuming you execute the trades using the same order types. It's recommended to trade where the liquidity is greater unless your trading method benefits somehow from it being lower. It's important to remember that some ADRs (some European companies listed in US) have ADR fees which vary. USD/EUR transaction fees are low when using a decent broker but you're obviously participating in the currency risk.,"Buying US stocks on US exchanges as a European can be advantageous due to broader diversification, access to some of the world's largest companies, and exposure to the US dollar, which might serve as a hedge against the euro. However, it requires understanding the tax implications, such as the US estate tax and potential double taxation, though some relief may be provided through tax treaties. Additionally, consider currency exchange rates and transaction costs, which might reduce net returns. Ultimately, whether it's better depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the complexity you're willing to manage in your portfolio.",3
Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it?,"“Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it? (When printing money, one doesn't need to pay interest).”  Good question.  Numerous leading economists, including a couple of economics Nobel Laureates have asked the same question and concluded that borrowing can be dispensed with. First, Milton Freidman set out a monetary system in a paper in the American Economic Review which involved no government borrowing, and govt just printed money (in a responsible fashion of course) as and when needed.  See: http://www.jstor.org/pss/1810624 A second Nobel Laureate with similar views was William Vickrey. A third economist with similar views (of Keynes’ era) was Abba Lerner. Keynes said of Lerner, “Lerner's argument is impeccable, but heaven help anyone who tries to put it across to the plain man at this stage of the evolution of our ideas”.","Governments borrow money instead of printing it to avoid inflation, which can occur when too much money chases too few goods, leading to price increases. Borrowing, rather than printing, helps maintain the currency's value and economic stability. Furthermore, if a government simply printed money for all its needs, it could undermine confidence in the currency and the economy, both domestically and internationally. Borrowing, through issuing bonds, allows governments to finance their operations and investments in a manner that supports economic growth without directly increasing the money supply, thereby managing inflation and promoting investor confidence.",1
how derivatives transfer risk from one entity to another,"The important thing to realize is, what would you do, if you didn't have the call? If you didn't have call options, but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock, you would have to actually purchase it. But, having purchased the shares, you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of them-- if the company folded or something like that.  A call option reduces the potential loss, since you are at worst only out the cost of the call, and you also lose a little on the upside, since you had to pay for the call, which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly. Risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes, so since calls/shorts etc. reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains, they pretty much by definition reduce risk. It's also worth noting, that when you buy a call, the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price. So, they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time, while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option. Shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls, and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management: making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies. While either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations, both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get, and exactly what they will have to pay for it, so that certainty is worth something, and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed. Of course you can use them for speculative purposes, and a good number of firms/people do but that's not really why they were invented.","Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, index, or interest rate. They enable entities to transfer risk by allowing parties to speculate on or hedge against future changes in the underlying asset's price. For example, a farmer can sell a futures contract to lock in the price of their crop, transferring the risk of price fluctuation to the buyer of the contract. Similarly, an investor can buy a put option to sell a stock at a predetermined price, transferring the risk of the stock's decline in value to the seller of the put option. This risk transfer mechanism is fundamental to the functioning of modern financial markets, allowing entities to manage exposure to various risks.",2
Adding a 180 day expiration to checks,"Your bank has discretion to honor checks after 6 months, so you should talk to your bank about their specific policy. In general, banks won't accept ""large"" stale checks. The meaning of ""large"" varies -- $25,000 in NYC, as little as $2k in other places. Banks that service high-volume check issuers (like rebate companies) reject checks at 180 days. For business purposes, I think some banks will create accounts for specific mailings or other purposes as well. (i.e. 2011 refund account) The accounts close after a year.","Implementing a 180-day expiration policy on checks can provide various benefits for a business. It aids in financial forecasting and budget management by ensuring a more predictable cash flow, reducing the risk of unexpected cash outflows from old checks being cashed. This policy also helps in maintaining accurate financial records and can potentially decrease the likelihood of fraud, as outstanding checks are less likely to be altered or used unauthorizedly. It's essential, however, to communicate this policy clearly to all parties issuing or receiving checks to avoid confusion and potential disruptions in business or personal financial management.",1
Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?,"Congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom. Some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing. Some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing.  Determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income, required monthly living expense, and the need to save for emergencies is highly individualized.  Keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense, it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score. Keep in mind it is a deduction, not a credit, so how much you save depends on your tax bracket.  It might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two, but you can't just assume that that advice applies in your situation. Personally I paid off my student loan early, as soon as it made sense based on my income, and my situation. I am glad I did, but for others the opposite made more sense.","Keeping student debt, rather than paying it off quickly, can be advisable for a few reasons. If the interest rates on your loans are low, it might make more financial sense to invest your money where it can earn a higher return than the interest accruing on your debt. Additionally, student loans often offer flexible repayment options and potential tax advantages, where the interest paid on the loan might be deductible. Prioritizing high-interest debt, establishing an emergency fund, or saving for retirement could be more beneficial in the long term, leveraging your debt as a tool to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility.",2
Can a company block a specific person from buying its stock?,"A more serious problem: how do you know who's really buying your stock? ""Shell companies"" are an increasingly obvious problem in corporate and tax accountability. There are jurisdictions where companies can be created with secret lists of directors and shareholders. If stock is bought by one of these companies, it is very hard to trace it to a particular individual.","Generally, a company cannot block a specific person from buying its stock if it's publicly traded, as shares are bought and sold on open markets without direct control from the company itself. However, there are exceptional circumstances, such as legal or regulatory actions, that could potentially restrict certain individuals from trading if they're deemed insiders or if there are concerns about market manipulation. Otherwise, the nature of public stock markets is to allow the free exchange of shares among investors, without discrimination or restriction on the basis of an individual's identity.",1
What are the pros and cons of buying an item on installments with zero percent interest?,"I personally take the zero percent financing plans any day.  I have done this with my car and the iphone 6s.  The vendors are trying to make it more attractive for you to ""afford"" the product.  It could show up on your credit report and impact the amount of money you can borrow in the future (e.g getting a home loan).  The other thing I do is make sure the monthly payments are automatically paid from my bank account so I don't miss any payments","Buying an item on installments at zero percent interest allows for the distribution of payment over time without additional cost, easing the financial burden and enabling the acquisition of expensive items sooner. It can also potentially improve credit scores when payments are made punctually. However, it might encourage overspending or purchasing non-essential items due to the perception of affordability. Additionally, there may be hidden fees or stringent conditions that could lead to unexpected costs. Failure to meet payments can result in penalties and negatively impact credit scores, outweighing the initial benefit of interest-free repayment.",1
why do energy stocks trade at lower prices compared to other sectors?,"I don't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others. It doesn't really matter much. Whether a company has 1,000,0000 shares selling for $100 each, or 10,000,000 shares selling for $10 each, either way the total value is the same. Companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount, they can. Like if the price was $10,000 per share, than an investor with less than $10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market. If it's $10, then if someone wants $10 they can buy one share, and if someone wants $10,000 they can buy 1000 shares. As to why energy stocks are volatile, I can think of several reasons. One, in our current world, energy is highly susceptible to politics. A lot of the world's energy comes from the Middle East, which is a notoriously unstable region. Any time there's conflict there, energy supplies from the region become uncertain. Oil-producing countries may embargo countries that they don't like. A war will, at the very least, interfere with transportation and shipping, and may result in oil wells being destroyed. Etc. Two, energy is consumed when you use it, and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile. So you're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it. So if demand goes down, it is reflected immediately. Compare this to, say, clothing. Most people expect to keep the same clothes for years, wearing them repeatedly. (Hopefully washing them now and then!) So if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four, this might not have any immediate impact on your buying. It could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway. There is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts. But with energy, if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4, your consumption goes down immediately, within days. Three, really adding to number two, energy is highly perishable, especially some forms of energy. If a solar power station is capable of producing 10 megawatts but today there is only demand for 9 megawatts, you can't save the unused megawatt for some future time when demand is higher. It's gone. (You can charge a battery with it, but that's pretty limited.) You can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it, but you can't save the output of a power plant. Note numbers two and three also apply to food, which is why food production is also very volatile.","Energy stocks often trade at lower prices compared to other sectors due to the cyclical and volatile nature of the energy market, heavily influenced by fluctuating commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory policies affecting supply and demand. Additionally, concerns about long-term sustainability, the transition towards renewable energy sources, and potential environmental liabilities add to the sector's perceived risk, affecting valuations. Investors usually demand higher risk premiums for these uncertainties, leading to lower price-to-earnings ratios compared to more stable, less cyclical industries.",1
"First Job, should I save or invest?","Congrats on your first real job! Save as much as your can while keeping yourself (relatively) comfortable.  As to where to put your hard earned money, first establish why you want to save the money in the first place. Money is a mean to acquire the things we want or need in your life or the lives of others. Once your goals are set, then follow this order:","Congratulations on your first job! It's wise to start by saving enough to create an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses for unforeseen circumstances. Once this safety net is in place, start investing to let your money grow over time. Investing—even with small amounts—in diversified assets like index funds or ETFs can help you build wealth and benefit from compound interest. Balancing between saving for immediate needs and investing for the future is key to long-term financial health. Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation evolves.",2
Why is property investment good if properties de-valuate over time?,"One reason for this is that many people don't simply allow their houses to rot and decay. If you're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and unmaintained for 35 years, it probably will be in pretty poor shape.  But a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition, so they invest in things like new roofs, siding, gutters, windows, paint, exterminators, new furnaces, hot water heaters, air conditioners, etc... All this stuff costs money (and for tax purposes, can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold), but it maintains the value of the property. A small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix, but if left unrepaired, it could eventually cause much of the building to rot, making the structure near worthless. If a car slams into your living room, you don't generally leave it there; most people repair the damage.  It's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses (or 300+ year old houses in some countries) that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim.  People also renovate their homes, ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions, decks, porches, etc... This also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value.","Property investment can still be a good choice even if some properties devaluate over time because it typically offers multiple streams of income through rental earnings and the potential for capital appreciation in the long term. Property values fluctuate based on many factors, including location, demand, and economic conditions. Despite short-term devaluation risks, historically, real estate markets have shown resilience and growth over the long term, making property investment a viable option for diversifying investment portfolios, hedging against inflation, and generating steady income through rents, which can increase with inflation, providing an inflation-adjusted income stream.",1
Why are index funds called index funds?,"Because they track an index. Edited: The definition of the word in this case meaning ""something used or serving to point out; a sign, token, or indication"" from Meaning  #3 I presume therefore you are asking what an index is? There are many variations of what makes up an Index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market. An extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks, and sum their prices.  If one stock moves up a dollar, and one moves down a dollar, the index has effectively not changed, as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other.","Index funds are called so because they are designed to track or mimic the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, or Dow Jones Industrial Average. These funds aim to replicate the index's composition and performance by investing in the same stocks or assets in similar proportions. The term ""index"" refers to the statistical measure that reflects the composite value of a selected group of stocks, representing a specific segment of the market. Thus, ""index funds"" are investment vehicles that aim to offer investors broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover by following these indexes.",1
What does PMI mean?,"Private Mortgage Insurance. It's money that you pay to an insurance company to make the lender whole in the event that you go into default. It's a real waste of money for you. If you are trying to finance more than 80% of the value of a home, a standard mortage is likely to require that you get PMI. Nowadays there are other options which involve paying substantially more interest.","PMI stands for Private Mortgage Insurance, a type of insurance policy that borrowers must purchase when they put down less than 20% of a home's purchase price. It protects lenders against loss if a borrower defaults on their mortgage. PMI is typically included in the monthly mortgage payment and is common in conventional loans. The cost can vary based on the size of the down payment and the loan, but it allows individuals to purchase a home without needing a significant down payment, thereby lowering the barrier for homeownership.",1
How to distinguish gift from payment for the service?,"Generally, a one time thing is considered a gift. For the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense, except for some specific cases (for example promotional gifts under $25 to vendors can be deducted, if you're a business, or charitable contributions to a recognized charity). However, if this is a regular practice - that would not be considered as a gift, but rather as a tax fraud, a criminal offense. Being attentive I would like to make a little gift or give some little   (<100$) amount of money (cash/wire/online) for that Why? Generally, gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith. In the situation you describe this doesn't hold. When the gift is exempt from income to the receiver - the donor pays the tax (in this case, below exemption the tax is zero). If the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver - it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes, not the donor. The situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme. If someone does it consistently and regularly (as a receiver, donor, or both) - he would likely end up in jail.","Distinguishing between a gift and a payment for service often hinges on the intent and the context of the transaction. A gift is typically given voluntarily without the expectation of something in return, reflecting a personal relationship or appreciation. It is not contingent on the receiver performing a specific action or service. Conversely, a payment for service is a remuneration for services rendered or work performed, expecting the receiver to fulfill a particular obligation or task. Documenting the purpose, understanding the surrounding circumstances, and assessing whether there’s an implied quid pro quo are crucial steps in distinguishing between the two.",2
Recent college grad. Down payment on a house or car?,"Given the state of the economy, and the potential of a rough near future for us recent grads (i.e. on/off work), I would recommend holding off on large purchases while your life is in flux.  This includes both a NEW car and purchasing a house. My short answer is: you need a reliable vehicle, so purchase a used car, from a major dealer (yes this will add a fairly high premium, but easier financing), that is 4-5 years old, or more.  Barring the major dealer purchase, be sure to get a mechanic to check out a vehicle, many will offer this service for a reasonable payment.  As people point out, cars these days will run for another 100k miles.  You will NOT have to pay anywhere near $27,000 for this vehicle.  You may need to leverage your 10k for a loan if you choose to finance, but it should not be a problem, especially as you seem to imply an established credit history. In addition to this, start saving your money for the house you would like to eventually get.  We have no idea where you live, but, picking rough numbers, assuming a 2 year buy period, 20% down, and a $250,000 home, the down payment alone will require you to save ~$2,000/month starting now. Barring either of these options, max out your money to tax sheltered accounts (your Roth IRA, work 401k, or a regular IRA) asap.  Obviously, do not deplete your emergency fund, if anything, increase it.  10k can be burned through in a heartbeat. Long Answer:  I purchased a brand new car, right out of school, at a reasonable interest rate.  Like you, I can afford this vehicle, however, if someone were to come to me today (3.5 years later) and offer me the opportunity to take it back and purchase a 4-5 year used vehicle, at a 4-5 year used car price, albeit at a much higher interest rate (since I financed), it would be about a 0.02 second decision. I like my car, but, I'd like the differential cash savings between it and a reliable used car more.  $27,000 is also fairly expensive for a new vehicle, there are many, very nice vehicles, for 21-23k.  I still would not consider these priced appropriate to spend your money on them, but they exist.  However, you do very much need a reliable vehicle, and I think you should get one. On the home front, your $400 all inclusive rent is insanely cheap.  Many people spend more than that on property tax and PMI each year, so anyone who throws the ""You're throwing money away!"" line at you is blowing smoke to justify their own home purchase.  Take the money you would have spent on a mortgage, and squirrel it away.  Do your own due diligence and research the home market in your area and decide for yourself if you think home prices have bottomed and will stay there, have further to go, or are going to begin to rise.  That is a decision only you can make for yourself. I'd add a section about getting expenses under control, but you said you could save 50% of your takehome pay.  This is an order of magnitude above the average.  Good job.  Try doing 50% for 4 months, then calculate your actual amount.  Then try to beat it.","As a recent college grad, prioritizing a down payment on a house over a car may be more financially beneficial in the long term. Real estate typically appreciates in value, offering potential equity growth and tax advantages. While a car is essential for transportation, it depreciates quickly. Considering your future financial goals, investing in a house could contribute to building your wealth. However, evaluate your current financial stability, job security, and lifestyle needs. If mobility and lower initial costs are priorities, a car might be suitable for now, with a house as a future goal.",1
Comparing keeping old car vs. a new car lease,"Look at the basic cost of the lease.  Option 1: keep the car for three years. Pay for repairs during that time then sell it for $7,000. Option 2: Sell the current car for $10,000. Lease a new car for three years. Assume no need for repairs during those three years. At the end of the three years return the car in return for $0. Cost of option 1 is $3000 plus repairs.  Cost of Option 2 is 36 months x monthly lease cost. The first $83 of the monthly lease cost is to cover the $3000 fixed cost of option 1. The rest of the monthly lease cost is to cover the cost of repairs. Also remember that some leases have a initial down payment due at signing, and penalties for condition, and excess mileage. The lease company may also require a higher level of insurance for the lease to cover their investment if you have an accident.  Plus If you fall in love with a different car two year from now, or your needs change you are locked in until the end of the lease period.","Choosing between keeping an old car and leasing a new one hinges on cost-efficiency, financial stability, and personal preferences. Retaining an old car often means lower insurance costs and no monthly lease payments, but potentially higher maintenance expenses as the vehicle ages. Leasing a new car ensures driving a modern vehicle with the latest features and lower repair costs, thanks to warranty coverages, in exchange for consistent monthly payments and possible mileage restrictions. Financially, if you're seeking to minimize monthly outflows and can manage potential repair costs, keeping the old car may be preferable. Conversely, if you prioritize predictable expenses, newer technology, and driving a new vehicle every few years without the hassle of selling or buying, leasing could be the better option.",1
How does giving to charity work?,"For many people, giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes. Non-profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible, but for most people, it doesn't work out that way. You will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction. The IRS allows you to either ""itemize"" your deductions (where you list each deduction you can take) or take the ""standard deduction"". Consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011. Their standard deduction is $11,400. They are in the 28% tax bracket. They donate $100 of old clothes to the Goodwill, and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes, and getting $28 of that back. If that's their only deduction, though, they'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction. Not worth it. Suppose instead they have $11,500 of deductions in 2011. Now we're talking, right? No. The tax impact of itemizing is only $28, since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $100. The cost of having a tax accountant fill out the itemization form probably offsets that small gain. There's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year. Not worth it.  Tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction. You need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold. For most people, this only happens when they have a mortgage, as the interest on a residence is deductible.  Folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal, because the interest is deductible. However, since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize, it's not likely to be a big win. For most people: TL;DR: Give to charity because you want that charity to have your money. Tax implications are minimal; let your accountant sort it out. Disclaimer: I am not an accountant.","Giving to charity involves donating money, goods, or time to organizations aimed at helping people, animals, or causes in need. Donors can give directly to a charity or through a charitable foundation or fund. Many donations, especially monetary ones, to registered charities are tax-deductible, potentially lowering the donor's taxable income. It's essential to research and ensure the charity is legitimate and that a significant portion of donations go directly to the cause. Besides financial benefits, giving to charity can fulfill personal values, offer a sense of community, and contribute to making a positive impact in society.",1
Why is routing number called ABA/ABN number?,"With number of Banks increasing every country at some point in time adopted an Identification code. In US these are called ABA number because they are allocated by American Bankers Association, in UK Sort Codes ... like wise for other countries. See list here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_code In some countries the numbers are given by Central Bank.   To enable internationl payments, the SWIFT body apart from message formats, allocated a  SWIFT BIC [Bank identification Code] so that Banks can be globally identified. Currently  IBAN being adopted in Europe & Australia to identify an Account [at a Bank] Uniquely across globe. In essence these number help uniquely identify a Location/Bank/Branch. The clearing house route the payments or collection instruments to the correct Bank on the basis of this number.","The term ABA/ABN number refers to the American Bankers Association (ABA) Number, unique identifiers assigned to each financial institution in the United States. The name ""ABA"" comes from the association that originally created these numbers in 1910 to streamline the processing and clearance of cheques. This system was developed to identify the specific bank or financial institution involved in a transaction, improving the efficiency and security of the banking system. The term ""ABN"" is less commonly used in this context and can lead to confusion with Australian Business Numbers, which are unrelated. Therefore, ""ABA number"" is the correct term when discussing banking routing numbers in the U.S.",1
How did I end up with a fraction of a share?,"Theoretically, yes, you can only buy or sell whole shares (which is why you still have .16 shares in your account; you can't sell that fraction on the open market). This is especially true for voting stock; stock which gives you voting rights in company decisions makes each stock one vote, so effectively whomever controls the majority of one stock gets that vote. However, various stock management policies on the part of the shareholder, brokerage firm or the issuing company can result in you owning fractional shares. Perhaps the most common is a retirement account or other forward-planning account. In such situations, it's the dollar amount that counts; when you deposit money you expect the money to be invested in your chosen mix of mutual funds and other instruments. If the whole-shares rule were absolute, and you wanted to own, for instance, Berkshire Hathaway stock, and you were contributing a few hundred a month, it could take you your entire career of your contributions sitting in a money-market account (essentially earning nothing) before you could buy even one share. You are virtually guaranteed in such situations to end up owning fractions of shares in an investment account. In these situations, it's usually the fund manager's firm that actually holds title to the full share (part of a pool they maintain for exactly this situation), and your fractional ownership percentage is handled purely with accounting; they give you your percentage of the dividends when they're paid out, and marginal additional investments increase your actual holdings of the share until you own the whole thing. If you divest, the firm sells the share of which you owned a fraction (or just holds onto it for the next guy fractionally investing in the stock; no need to pay unnecessary broker fees) and pays you that fraction of the sale price.  Another is dividend reinvestment; the company may indicate that instead of paying a cash dividend, they will pay a stock dividend, or you yourself may indicate to the broker that you want your dividends given to you as shares of stock, which the broker will acquire from the market and place in your account. Other common situations include stock splits that aren't X-for-1. Companies often aren't looking to halve their stock price by offering a two-for-one split; they may think a smaller figure like 50% or even smaller is preferable, to fine tune their stock price (and thus P/E ratio and EPS figures) similar to industry competitors or to companies with similar market capitalization. In such situations they can offer a split that's X-for-Y with X>Y, like a 3-for-2, 5-for-3 or similar. These are relatively uncommon, but they do happen; Home Depot's first stock split, in 1987, was a 3-for-2. Other ratios are rare, and MSFT has only ever been split 2-for-1. So, it's most likely that you ended up with the extra sixth of a share through dividend reinvestment or a broker policy allowing fractional-share investment.","You ended up with a fraction of a share through a process called 'fractional share investing,' which allows investors to purchase a part of a share rather than a whole share. This can happen when participating in dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) where your dividends are used to buy more shares, or through direct stock purchase plans and certain investment platforms that offer fractional investing.

Why do financial institutions charge so much to convert currency?,"Is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data? Sure.  But this doesn't matter.  All the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically.  But the banks/PayPal don't care about the historical value.  They want to know the price that they'll pay when they get around to switching, not the last price before the switch.  Beyond that, there is a transaction cost to switching.  They have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction.   The banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse, but that increases their risk.  If the bank has a large balance of US dollars but dollars are falling, then they end up eating that cost.  They'll only take that risk if they think that they'll make more money that way.  And in the end, they may have to go on the currency market anyway.  If a European bank runs out of US dollars, they have to buy them on the open market.  Or a US bank might run out of Euros.  Or Yen.  Etc.   Another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small, but the overhead is fixed.  If the bank has to pay $5 for every currency transaction, they won't even break even charging 3% on a $100 transaction.  So they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time.  But then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime.  If they credit you with $97 in your account ($100 minus the 3% fee) but the price actually drops from $100 to $99, they're out the $1.   They could do it the other way as well.  You ask for a $100 transaction.  They perform a $1000 transaction, of which they give you $97.  Now they have $898 ($1000 minus the $5 they paid for the transaction plus the $3 they charged you for the transaction).  If there's a 1% drop, they're out $10.98 ($8.98 in currency loss plus a net $2 in fees).   This is why banks have money market accounts.  So they have someone to manage these problems working twenty-four hours a day.  But then they have to pay interest on those accounts, further eating into their profits.  Along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them.","Financial institutions charge high fees for currency conversion primarily due to the complexity and risk associated with foreign exchange operations. These transactions involve working within volatile currency markets where rates can fluctuate significantly, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Additionally, the costs cover operational expenses, including compliance with financial regulations, executing secure transactions, and providing customer service. There's also a profit margin built into these fees, as with any service. Lastly, limited competition and consumer willingness to pay for convenience and speed can allow institutions to maintain higher charges for these services.",2
Is it a good investment for a foreigner to purchase a flat/apartment in China?,"I think a greater problem would be the protection of your property right.  China hasn't shown much respect for the property rights of its own citizens - moving people off subsistence farms in order to build high-rise apartments - so I'm not certain that a foreigner could expect much protection.  A first consideration in any asset purchase should always be consideration of the strength of local property law.  By all accounts, China fails.","Investing in a flat or apartment in China as a foreigner can be complex due to the country's unique property ownership laws, which generally offer ""land use rights"" rather than outright ownership as understood in many Western countries. This means that while you can own a building or an apartment, the land it sits on is leased, often for periods up to 70 years, after which the lease might need to be renewed. Additionally, regulatory shifts can affect foreign ownership rights and the real estate market's dynamics. While there could be opportunities for appreciation and rental income, these come with significant legal, regulatory, and market risks. It's crucial to thoroughly research and possibly consult with a local real estate expert or legal advisor to navigate these complexities.",1
What is needed to be a “broker”?,"You must understand that: So, if you -- the prospective buyer -- are in Waukegan, do you take the train all the way to New York City just to buy 100 shares of stock?  No.  That would be absurdly expensive.  So, you hire an agent in NYC who will broker a deal for you in the exchange. Fast forward 100 years, to the time when instant communications is available.  Why do we now still need brokerages, when the Exchanges could set up web sites and let you do the trading? The answer is that the Exchanges don't want to have to develop the accounting systems to manage the transactions of hundreds of thousands of small traders, when existing brokerage firms already have those computerized processes in place and are opening their own web sites. Thus, in 2017 we have brokerage firms because of history.","To become a broker, one generally needs to obtain a bachelor's degree in finance, business, or a related field; pass the General Securities Representative Exam (Series 7) and the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination (Series 63) administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA); gain sponsorship from a registered SEC brokerage firm; and apply for a license through FINRA. Continuous education and adherence to regulatory requirements are essential for maintaining the license. Additionally, strong analytical, sales, customer service, and communication skills are crucial for success in this role.",3
How to calculate ownership for property with a partner,"To add to ChrisInEdmonton's answer: Your conveyancing solicitor should be able to advise on the details, but a typical arrangement involves: As an alternative to the numbers in Chris' answer, it could be argued that you should first be reimbursed for the fees you paid (accounting for inflation), but that any remaining profits from the property itself should be divided in proportion to your individual investments (so 51.6% to you, and 48.4% to your partner, assuming you contribute to the loans equally).","Calculating ownership for property with a partner involves determining each person's financial contribution towards the acquisition. Ownership can be proportional to the amount each partner contributes. For example, if Partner A contributes 60% of the total cost and Partner B covers the remaining 40%, ownership would reflect those percentages. This arrangement can be legally structured through a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common agreement, specifying each partner’s ownership stake in the property's title. It's essential for both partners to agree on this distribution and document it appropriately to prevent future disputes.",2
Digital envelope system: a modern take,"If psychologically there is no difference to you between cash and debit (you should test this over a couple of months on yourself and spouse to make sure), then I suggest two debit cards (one for you and spouse) on your main or separate checking account. If you use Mint you can set budgets for each category (envelope) and when a purchase is made Mint will automatically categorize that transaction and deduct that amount from the correct budget.  For example: If you have a ""Fast Food"" budget set at $100 per month and you use the debit at McDonalds, Mint should automatically categorize it as ""Fast Food"" and deduct the amount from the ""Fast Food"" budget that you set.  If it can't determine a category or gets it wrong, you can just select the proper category. Mint has an iPhone (also Android and Windows phone) app that I find very easy to use. Many people state that they don't have this psychologically difference between spending cash and debit/credit, but I would say that most actually do, especially with small purchases.  It doesn't have anything to do with intellect or knowing that you are actually spending money.  It has more to do with tangibility, and the physical act of handing over cash.  You may not add that soda and candy bar to your purchase if you have visible cash in your wallet that will disappear more quickly.  I lived in Germany for 2 years before debit cards were around or common.  I'm a sharp guy and even though I knew that I paid $100 for the 152 DM, it still kind of felt like spending Monopoly money, especially considering that in the US we are used to coins normally being 25 cents or less and in Germany coins are up to 10 DM (almost $10) and are used more frequently than paper.","The digital envelope system is a modern adaptation of the traditional envelope budgeting method, where money is divided into envelopes for different spending categories. In its digital form, this approach utilizes software or apps to allocate funds into virtual ""envelopes"" for various expenses, such as rent, groceries, or entertainment. It allows users to precisely track spending, avoid overspending in each category, and adjust allocations on-the-go. By embracing technology, this method combines the discipline of envelope budgeting with the convenience and efficiency of digital tools, making it easier for individuals to manage their finances and achieve their financial goals.",1
Long term investing alternative to mutual funds,"You are not limited in these 3 choices. You can also invest in ETFs, which are similar to mutual funds, but traded like stocks. Usually (at least in Canada), MERs for ETFs are smaller than for mutual funds.","As a wealth management advisor, I would suggest considering Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as a long-term investing alternative to mutual funds. ETFs offer the diversification and professional management of mutual funds but with lower expense ratios and greater flexibility because they can be traded like stocks throughout the trading day. Additionally, ETFs often provide better tax efficiency due to their unique creation and redemption process. For clients looking for long-term investment options outside mutual funds, ETFs present a compelling choice, blending the benefits of diversification, cost-effectiveness, and trading convenience.",1
Why do interest rates increase or decrease?,"My answer is specific to the US because you mentioned the Federal Reserve, but a similar system is in place in most countries. Do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing, or do they solely increase based on what the Federal Reserve sets them at? There are actually two rates in question here; the Wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that I'll summarize here. The interest rate that's usually referred to is the federal funds rate, and it's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the Federal Reserve. The nominal federal funds rate - this is a target set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). When you hear in the media that the Fed is changing interest rates, this is almost always what they're referring to. The actual federal funds rate - through the trading desk of the New York Federal Reserve, the FOMC conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate, thus leading to the actual rate, which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the Fed's operations. Open market operations involve buying and selling short-term securities in order to influence the rate. As an example, the current nominal federal funds rate is 0% (in economic parlance, this is known as the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)), while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points, or 0.25%. Why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the Federal Reserve ends QE3? I don't understand why interest rates are going to increase. In the United States, quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the Fed conducts. Open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short-term Treasury securities; in QE, however (especially the latest and ongoing round, QE3), the Fed has been purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). By purchasing MBS, the Fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market. Furthermore, the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt, which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market. To clarify: the debt market I'm referring to is the market for mortgage-backed securities and other debt derivatives (CDO's, for instance). I'll use MBS as an example. The actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool. This process may happen numerous times, since derivatives can be created based on the value of the MBS themselves, which in turn are based on housing debt. In other words, MBS aren't exactly the same thing as housing debt, but they're based on housing debt. It's these packaged securities the Fed is purchasing, not the mortgages themselves.  Once the Fed draws down QE3, however, this demand will probably decrease. As the Fed unloads its balance sheet over several years, and demand decreases throughout the market, prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall. Ideally, the Fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities.  Just to be clear, the interest rates that QE3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about. It's possible for the Fed to unwind QE3, while still keeping the ""interest rate"", i.e. the federal funds rate, near zero. although this is considered unlikely. Also, the Fed can target long-term vs. short-term interest rates as well, which is once again slightly different from what I talked about above. This was the goal of the Operation Twist program in 2011 (and in the 1960's). Kirill Fuchs gave a great description of the program in this answer, but basically, the Fed purchased long-term securities and sold short-term securities, with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long-term interest rates relative to short-term rates. The goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long-term debt, e.g. mortgages, capital investments, etc. My main question that I'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are. Is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity? Hopefully I addressed much of this above, but I'll give a quick summary. There are many ""interest rates"" in numerous different financial markets. The rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that I mentioned above; although it's a target set by the Board of Governors, it's not arbitrary. There's a reason the Federal Reserve hires hundreds of research economists. No central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate; it's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future, whatever those may be.  In the US, current Fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy surpasses the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the Evans Rule (named after Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who pushed for the rule). The effective federal funds rate, as well as other rates the Fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt, long-term rates on Treasury securities, etc. are market driven. The Fed may enter the market, but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work. Although the Fed's actions are controversial, the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces, so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary.","Interest rates increase or decrease based on decisions made by a country's central bank, reflecting its monetary policy objectives. Typically, a central bank will raise interest rates to combat high inflation or cool down an overheating economy by making borrowing more expensive, thereby slowing down spending and investment. Conversely, rates are decreased to stimulate economic growth during periods of economic stagnation or recession by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending, and investment. Other factors influencing interest rate adjustments include unemployment rates, economic growth data, and external economic factors like global financial crises or significant changes in trade relationships.",1
Value of put if underlying stays below strike?,"The value at expiration does not depend on the price path for a plain vanilla European or American option. At expiration, the value would simply be: max[K - S_T, 0], where: K is the strike price, and S_T is the underlying price at expiration.","If the underlying asset's price remains below the strike price at expiration, the value of a put option is generally the difference between the strike price and the underlying asset's price. This is known as intrinsic value. The further the underlying price is below the strike price, the more valuable the put option becomes, since the option grants the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the higher strike price. However, if the underlying price is very close to the strike price, the value of the put option may be low or primarily consist of any remaining time value rather than intrinsic value.",3
"For the first time in my life, I'm going to be making real money…what should I do with it?","On the one hand, it's a great idea to open a Roth IRA now, once you've got the cash to contribute. It's a tax designation sounds like it would fit your meager earnings this year. The main reason to open one now rather than later is that some types of withdrawls require the account be aged 5 years. But you can also withdraw the amount you've contributed tax free any time. Student loans right now are pricey, so if you're carrying a balance at say 6.8 percent fixed you should pay that down ASAP. Beyond that, I'd keep the rest liquid for now. Having that kind of liquid cash is extremely reassuring, and many of the biggest returns on investment are going to be in your personal life. More fuel efficient vehicles, energy efficient appliances, computer backups, chest freezers and bulk meat purchases, etc.  One example I see every six months is car insurance: I can pay for six months in full or I can pay a smaller monthly bill plus a small fee. That fee is well above current market rates. You see this everywhere; people searching for lower minimum payments rather than lower total costs. Save your money up and be the smart buyer. It's too damn expensive to be broke.","Congratulations on reaching this exciting financial milestone. Initially, prioritize establishing an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses to safeguard against unexpected events. Following that, focus on paying down any high-interest debts you may have, as this guarantees a return on your money by saving on interest costs. Next, take advantage of any employer-matched retirement plans available to you, such as a 401(k), as this is essentially free money towards your retirement. Lastly, consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and establish a solid foundation for growing your wealth over time.",1
Why don't market indexes use aggregate market capitalization?,"They do but you're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding. Intro To Stock Index Weighting Methods notes in part: Market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index.   Market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the   size of the company. You might have heard of large, mid, or small cap   stocks? Large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index. And   most of the major indices, like the S&P 500, use the market cap   weighting method. Stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total   market cap of all the stocks in the index. As a stock’s price and   market cap rises, it gains a bigger weighting in the index. In turn   the opposite, lower stock price and market cap, pushes its weighting   down in the index.  Pros Proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the   economy and are more widely owned. So they should have a bigger   representation when measuring the performance of the market. Which is   true. Cons It doesn’t make sense as an investment strategy. According to a market   cap weighted index, investors would buy more of a stock as its price   rises and sell the stock as the price falls. This is the exact   opposite of the buy low, sell high mentality investors should use. Eventually, you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in   underpriced stocks. Yet most index funds follow this weighting method. Thus, there was likely a point in time where the S & P 500's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here. Also, how do you handle when constituents change over time? For example, suppose in the S & P 500 that a $100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $10,000,000,000 company that shouldn't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced? Consider carefully how you answer that question. In terms of histories, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 Index would be covered on Wikipedia where from the latter link: The ""Composite Index"",[13] as the S&P 500 was first called when it   introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small   number of stocks. Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index   expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current   500.[13] Standard & Poor's, a company that doles out financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor. In   1941 Poor's Publishing (Henry Varnum Poor's original company) merged   with Standard Statistics (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics   Bureau) and therein assumed the name Standard and Poor's Corporation.   The S&P 500 index in its present form began on March 4, 1957.   Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in   real time. The S&P 500 is widely used as a measure of the general   level of stock prices, as it includes both growth stocks and value   stocks. In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. entered into an agreement   with Standard and Poor's. Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics   computed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial   Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.   Throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to Standard   & Poor's. In addition, Ultronics also computed and reported the 94 S&P   sub-indexes.[14] There are also articles like Business Insider that have this graphic that may be interesting: S & P changes over the years The makeup of the S&P 500 is constantly changing notes in part: ""In most years 25 to 30 stocks in the S&P 500 are replaced,"" said   David Blitzer, S&P's Chairman of the Index Committee. And while there   are strict guidelines for what companies are added, the final decision   and timing of that decision depends on what's going through the heads   of a handful of people employed by Dow Jones.","Market indexes do not solely use aggregate market capitalization because it would give disproportionate influence to larger companies, potentially skewing the index's representation of the market's overall performance. To mitigate this, indexes might use price weighting, equal weighting, or a modified market capitalization weighting. This adaptation helps ensure a more balanced and diversified index composition, reflecting a broader and more accurate picture of market trends and investor sentiment across different sectors and company sizes. Each weighting methodology offers a different perspective on the market, catering to varied investment strategies and objectives.",1

So you can amend your return/file it late within a certain window and things should be OK.

What is a Discount Called in the Context of a Negative Interest Rate?,"Negative Yields on Bonds is opposite of Getting profit on your investment.

Now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where I am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount!

The same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. Savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually/half-yearly/monthly.

Where should I invest to hedge against the stock market going down?,"There are multiple ETFs which inversely track the common indices, though many of these are leveraged.  For example, SDS tracks approximately -200% of the S&P 500.  (Note: due to how these are structured, they are only suitable for very short term investments) You can also consider using Put options for the various indices as well.  For example, you could buy a Put for the SPY out a year or so to give you some fairly cheap insurance (assuming it's a small part of your portfolio). One other option is to invest against the market volatility.  As the market makes sudden swings, the volatility goes up; this tends to be true more when it falls than when it rises.  One way of invesing in market volatility is to trade options against the VIX.","To hedge against the stock market going down, diversification into assets uncorrelated or inversely correlated to the stock market is key. Consider investments in precious metals like gold, which often serves as a safe haven during market volatility, or fixed-income securities such as Treasury bonds, which tend to perform inversely to stock markets. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and alternative investments, including commodities and cryptocurrency, might also offer a buffer. Additionally, certain hedge funds are designed to perform well during market downturns. Always ensure that your investment choices align with your overall risk tolerance and investment timeline.",1
What happens to the insider trade profits?,"You seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up: You are calling this ""day-trading"" Day-trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day. While it appears that the COO has performed a buy and a sell on the same day, most people would consider this a 'single trade'. In reality, it seems that the COO had 'stock options' [a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price, at some point in the future], provided as part of his compensation package. He decided or was required to 'exercise' those options today. This means he bought the shares using his special 'option price'. It is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options, to sell all of the resulting stock immediately. This is very different from usual day-trading, which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price, and then sold it later at a high price. You are calling this 'insider trading'. That term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior. In general, stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised. For example, most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them. This gives the employee incentive to stay longer, and for a high-level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance, it gives incentive to do well. Technically you are correct, this is likely considered an 'insider trade', but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise, it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today. It could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise. As to your final question - no, these profits are the COO's, to do with as he likes.","Insider trading profits, if the trade is deemed legal, are retained by the individual or entity that made the trade. However, if the trade is found to be illegal, based on the use of non-public, material information, the profits are subject to disgorgement, meaning they must be surrendered. Additionally, the individual or entity may face penalties, fines, and potentially criminal charges. The severity of the repercussions depends on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the trade. The enforcement of these penalties is aimed at maintaining market integrity and investor confidence.",3

The tax implication is determined by the gain or loss from the sale of the stock, regardless of repurchasing it shortly after. However, if your action triggers a wash sale by repurchasing the same stock or a substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after the sale, the IRS prohibits you from claiming the loss on your tax return. The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased stock, adjusting future gains or losses.

Can a credit card company raise my rates for making a large payment?,"No. Credit card companies will typically not care about your individual credit card account. Instead they look either at a ""package"" of card accounts opened at roughly the same time, or of ""slices"" of cardholder accounts by credit rating. If an entire package's or slice's balance drops significantly, they'll take a look, and will adjust rates accordingly (often they may actually decrease rates as an incentive to increase you use of the card). Because credit card debt is unstructured debt, the bank cannot impose an ""early payment penalty"" of any kind (there's no schedule for paying it off, so there's no way to prove that they're missing out on $X in interest because you paid early). Generally, banks don't like CC debt anyway; it's very risky debt, and they often end up writing large balances off for pennies on the dollar. So, when you pay down your balance by a significant amount, the banks breathe a sigh of relief. The real money, the stable money, is in the usage fees; every time you swipe your card, the business who accepted it owes the credit card company 3% of your purchase, and sometimes more.","Credit card companies typically do not raise rates specifically because you make a large payment. In fact, making large or additional payments can be viewed positively, as it reduces your credit utilization ratio, a key factor in credit scoring. Credit card rates are more commonly adjusted due to changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, a change in your credit risk profile (e.g., a significant drop in your credit score), or the expiration of a promotional rate. Always review your credit card agreement for specifics about how and when your interest rate can change.",2
"Should we prepay our private student loans, given our particular profile?","Based on your numbers, it sounds like you've got 12 years left in the private student loan, which just seems to be an annoyance to me.  You have the cash to pay it off, but that may not be the optimal solution. You've got $85k in cash!  That's way too much. So your options are:  -Invest 40k -Pay 2.25% loan off -Prepay mortgage 40k Play around with this link: mortgage calculator Paying the student loan, and applying the $315 to the monthly mortgage reduces your mortgage by 8 years. It also reduces the nag factor of the student loan. Prepaying the mortgage (one time) reduces it by 6 years. (But, that reduces the total cost of the mortgage over it's lifetime the most) Prepaying the mortgage and re-amortizing it over thirty years (at the same rate) reduces your mortgage payment by $210, which you could apply to the student loan, but you'd need to come up with an extra $105 a month.","Given that you're contemplating prepaying your private student loans, it's essential to evaluate your overall financial health, interest rates on the loans, and the opportunity cost. If your interest rates are high and you don't have higher-return investment opportunities or pressing debts, prepaying could save you on interest costs in the long run. Ensure you maintain an emergency fund and contribute sufficiently towards retirement savings. Also, check for prepayment penalties. If these conditions align favorably, and you're seeking peace of mind over debt, prepaying your private student loans can be a beneficial decision.",2
"Should Emergency Funds be Used for Infrequent, but Likely, Expenses?",I would suggest that you use Emergency Funds for things that have a Low likelihood of happening but if they do happen can be devastating. I used to work as a financial advisor and the sugfestion we gave people is to have about 3 months worth of expenses in cash. This was primarily to cover things luke loss of work or some unforseen even that would prevent you from missing work for an extended period of time. Once you have your emergency fund saved do not touch it! Leave it where it is. Then tou can start working on a savings account for those items that are more likely to happen but dont have as much of a negative impact.,"Emergency funds are primarily intended for unexpected, critical expenses, such as medical emergencies or sudden job loss, rather than infrequent but predictable expenses like car maintenance or annual property taxes. It's advisable to budget separately for these foreseeable costs by setting aside money each month. This approach ensures that your emergency fund remains intact and fully available for genuine emergencies, thereby maintaining your financial security by preventing the need to incur debt during unforeseen circumstances. Allocating funds specifically for predictable expenses helps in managing finances more effectively without compromising the safety net an emergency fund provides.",1
When's the best time to sell the stock of a company that is being acquired/sold?,"This is but one opinion.  Seek others before your act. ""When someone puts a million dollars in your hand, close your hand."" A 50% gain in two weeks is huge.","The best time to sell stock in a company that is being acquired typically depends on the acquisition's terms and market reaction. If the deal is all-cash, holding until the close could secure the agreed pay-out price. For stock-for-stock transactions, consider the acquiring company's prospects; if they're strong, holding on might be beneficial. Immediate selling post-announcement can capitalize on the acquisition premium if the stock jumps. However, watch for regulatory hurdles which might delay or derail the deal, causing volatility. Consistently track the acquiring company's performance and the acquisition's progress to make an informed decision.",3
Home loan transferred to Freddie Mac — What does this mean?,"Lenders may sell your mortgage to other lenders for a fee.  For example,  your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment.  For your lender that's a quick profit, for the new owner of your mortgage, that's long term returns for a one time fee.  For your lender, that is forgoing long term returns for short term gains (and transfer of risk in case you default).   (Very similar to how bonds work in a stock exchange!) What does this mean to you? Nothing.  You will still keep making payments to your original lender.   What does 'transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean'? It means, when you are asked about ownership details regarding your mortgage, and this could be in tax forms or refinancing etc., you would enter your original lender's information and not Freddit Mac's! Pro-tip There are lots of scams based on this.  You might receive an official looking letter in mail claiming your loan has been sold and you should start making payments to the new owner. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS! Call your original lender (use the phone number from your loan papers, not mail you received) and verify this information.   And if this were to happen, your original lender would always inform you first.   And hey, congrats on your new home! :)","When your home loan is transferred to Freddie Mac, it means your mortgage has been sold by the original lender to Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise that buys mortgages from lenders to help increase the liquidity of the mortgage market. This transaction doesn't affect the terms or conditions of your original mortgage agreement. Your loan servicer may change, and you will be notified accordingly since you'll direct future mortgage payments to the new servicer. However, the servicing of your loan – the handling of your mortgage payments, escrow accounts, etc. – is all that changes; the sale does not modify the terms of your loan.",1
Why do I get a much better price for options with a limit order than the ask price?,"There are people whose strategy revolves around putting orders at the bid and ask and making money off people who cross the spread.  If you put an order in between the current bid/ask, people running that type of strategy will usually pick it off, viewing it as a discount to the orders that they already have on the bid/ask.  Often these people are trading by computer, so your limit order may get hit so quickly that it appears instantaneous to you.  In reality, you were probably hit by a limit order placed specifically to fill against yours.","When you use a limit order to buy or sell options, you specify the maximum price you are willing to pay or the minimum price you are willing to accept. This allows you more control over the transaction price compared to accepting the market’s current ask price, which might be higher for purchases or lower for sales due to market spreads and volatility. By setting a limit order, you effectively wait for the market to meet your price preference, potentially leading to a more favorable price when the conditions align with your specified limit.",1
"How to execute a large stock purchase, relative to the order book?","I normally just do a buy limit at the price I want to buy it at. Then it executes when it's that price or lower, but there's still a chance you might purchase some shares at a larger price. But since we're small fry and using brokerages, there's not much we can do about it.","To execute a large stock purchase without significantly impacting the market price or revealing your position to other market participants, consider using a combination of techniques. Implementing an iceberg order, which breaks up the large order into smaller, less noticeable orders that are gradually released, can help. Additionally, employing a VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) strategy can ensure your trades are spread out through the day, aligning with the stock's average price and volume, thus reducing market impact. Engaging with a broker for a block trade is also advisable, as it allows for a large quantity of stocks to be bought or sold outside the open market, minimizing price displacement.",1
"Where should my money go next: savings, investments, retirement, or my mortgage?","As the others said, you're doing everything right. So, at this it's not a matter of what you should do, it's a matter of what do you want to do? What would make you the happiest?  So, what would you like to do most with that extra money? The point is, since you're already doing everything right with the rest of your money, there's really nothing you can do that's wrong with this money. Except using it on something that increases your monthly expenses, like a down payment on a car.  In fact, there's no reason you have to do anything ""sensible"" with this money at all. You could blow it at nightclubs if you wanted to, and that would be perfectly ok. In fact, since you've got everything else covered, why not ""invest"" it in making some memories? How about vacations to exotic and rugged places, while you're still young enough to enjoy them?","The decision on where to allocate your money depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. If you have an emergency fund in place, consider balancing between retirement savings, particularly if there's an employer match, and investments for potential growth. Prioritizing low-interest debt like a mortgage might come after these options, especially if your investment returns can outpace your mortgage interest rate. However, if you're nearing retirement or prioritize debt freedom, extra payments towards your mortgage might be more satisfying. Diversifying across savings, investments, and retirement can offer both security and growth opportunities.",1
What are the benefits of opening an IRA in an unstable/uncertain economy?,"Even Gold lost 1/2 of it's value between 1980 and 2000.   You would not have fared well if you retired during that period heavily invested in Gold. http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/history.html You said yourself that one can not foresee what the future will bring. At least IRA's force you to into dollar cost averaging, whereas if your money was outside of a retirement account, you might be tempted to speculate. -Ralph Winters","Opening an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) during times of economic instability can serve as a beneficial long-term investment strategy. It provides tax advantages that help preserve wealth, with traditional IRAs offering tax-deductible contributions and Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Additionally, IRAs often allow for a diversified investment portfolio, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which can mitigate risk through asset allocation. Despite short-term market fluctuations, the compounding effect of these investments over time can significantly enhance retirement savings, offering a sense of financial security in an otherwise uncertain economic climate.",2
How to determine duration of a common stock whose dividends grow in perpetuity?,"The Dividend Discount Model is based on the concept that the present value of a stock is the sum of all future dividends, discounted back to the present. Since you said: dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate in perpetuity ... the Gordon Growth Model is a simple variant of the DDM, tailored for a firm in ""steady state"" mode, with dividends growing at a rate that can be sustained forever. Consider McCormick (MKC), who's last dividend was 31 cents, or $1.24 annualized. The dividend has been growing just a little over 7% annually. Let's use a discount, or hurdle rate of 10%. MKC closed today at $50.32, for what it's worth. The model is extremely sensitive to inputs. As g approaches r, the stock price rises to infinity. If g > r, stock goes negative. Be conservative with 'g' -- it must be sustainable forever.  The next step up in complexity is the two-stage DDM, where the company is expected to grow at a higher, unsustainable rate in the early years (stage 1), and then settling down to the terminal rate for stage 2. Stage 1 is the present value of dividends during the high growth period. Stage 2 is the Gordon Model, starting at the end of stage 1, and discounting back to the present. Consider Abbott Labs (ABT). The current annual dividend is $1.92, the current dividend growth rate is 12%, and let's say that continues for ten years (n), after which point the growth rate is 5% in perpetuity. Again, the discount rate is 10%. Stage 1 is calculated as follows: Stage 2 is GGM, using not today's dividend, but the 11th year's dividend, since stage 1 covered the first ten years. 'gn' is the terminal growth, 5% in our case. then... The value of the stock today is 21.22 + 51.50 = 72.72 ABT closed today at $56.72, for what it's worth.","To determine the duration of a common stock whose dividends grow in perpetuity, you essentially measure the sensitivity of the stock's price to changes in the discount rate, which reflects the risk-adjusted return required by investors. The Gordon Growth Model, also known as the Dividend Discount Model for stocks with perpetual dividend growth, is often used for this purpose. Although the concept of duration is more directly applicable to bonds, for stocks, it involves calculating a weighted average time until the receipt of the dividend payments, taking into account the growth rate of these payments and the required rate of return. Given the complexity and the variability of stock dividends and market conditions, this calculation can be more conceptual than precise for stocks, often leading to the use of more direct methods of risk and return analysis for equity.",1
Rate of change of beta,This is a useful metric in that it gives you a trust factor on how reliable the beta is for future expectations   It is akin to velocity and acceleration  First  and second order derivatives of distance / time.  Erratic acceleration implies the velocity is less trustworthy  Same idea for beta,"The rate of change of beta in finance, often described through the concept of 'beta decay' in advanced financial models, quantifies how the beta of an investment or portfolio evolves over time. Beta represents the sensitivity of a stock's returns to market movements, with a higher beta indicating greater volatility compared to the market. The rate of change can be influenced by factors such as changes in a company's business model, industry dynamics, or overall market volatility. Understanding this rate is crucial for investors seeking to manage risk dynamically, as it helps in adjusting investment strategies to maintain desired levels of market exposure and portfolio volatility.",1
Am I “cheating the system” by opening up a tiny account with a credit union and then immediately applying for a huge loan?,"Credit Unions turn a profit by lending money at a higher interest rate than their savings do, just like banks do. It is an amoral feat, completely parallel to any moral weights you have assigned to ""the system"". If the most favorable circumstance is you receiving access to capital, then you can easily achieve that with zero reservations about the system that granted it to you.","Opening a tiny account at a credit union and then quickly applying for a large loan isn't ""cheating the system,"" but it may not work as expected. Credit unions, like other financial institutions, evaluate loan applications based on creditworthiness, income, debt-to-income ratio, and the purpose of the loan, among other factors. A newly opened account with minimal history might not significantly impact the lending decision. Moreover, attempting to manipulate perceived lending loopholes can harm your credit and banking relationships. It's crucial to build a solid financial foundation and relationship with the credit union before applying for significant loans.",1
Pay online: credit card or debit card?,"Nowadays, some banks in some countries offer things like temporary virtual cards for online payments. They are issued either free of charge or at a negligible charge, immediately, via bank's web interface (access to which might either be free or not, this varies). You get a separate account for the newly-issued ""card"" (the ""card"" being just a set of numbers), you transfer some money there (same web-interface), you use it to make payment(s), you leave $0 on that ""card"" and within a day or a month, it expires. Somewhat convenient and your possible loss is limited tightly. Check if your local banks offer this kind of service.","Choosing between paying online with a credit card or a debit card depends on your financial habits and goals. Credit cards are preferable for online transactions due to stronger fraud protections, the ability to earn rewards, and the potential to build credit. Additionally, if any dispute arises, you're not out of actual funds while it's being resolved, unlike with a debit card. However, if you struggle with budget discipline, a debit card ensures you spend only what you have, helping to avoid debt. Consider your financial security, discipline, and benefits like rewards or cashback when deciding.",1
What should I do with the stock from my Employee Stock Purchase Plan?,"While my margin is not nearly as good as yours, I sell out early.  I generally think it's a bad idea to hold any single stock, as they can vary wildly in value.  However, as you mention, it's advantageous to hold for one year.  Read more about Capital Gains Taxes here and here.","As a Wealth Management advisor, I recommend evaluating your current financial situation, investment goals, and the concentration of your portfolio in your company's stock. If the stock represents a large portion of your overall investment, consider selling some shares to diversify your risk. It's also wise to assess your company's performance and market outlook. If they're strong, holding onto some shares might be beneficial. However, always ensure your investment decisions align with your risk tolerance and financial objectives. It might also be prudent to consult a tax advisor regarding the implications of selling your shares.",1
Who could afford a higher annual deductible who couldn't afford a higher monthly payment?,"It's simple. Most people don't spend $6000 a year in medical care. As for myself, there's probably only $400 or less, mostly in annual checkups and the like.  If you are the type to require more medical care, then you will pay more per month. I know a person with asthma, kidney stones, and inflammatory issues. This person spends probably $1000 in co-pays per year, with considerable more if you were to include the hospital visits in the likes. But if you don't think you are one of these people, then don't get the higher cost plan.","Individuals with substantial emergency savings or liquid assets could afford a higher annual deductible because they have the financial cushion to cover larger out-of-pocket costs in case of a claim before insurance benefits kick in. On the other hand, those on a tight budget, with limited savings, or living paycheck to paycheck would struggle with higher deductibles but could better manage smaller, more predictable monthly payments to spread healthcare costs over time, making manageable monthly insurance premiums a more suitable option for their financial situation.

"UK student loans, early repayment/avoiding further debt","I think you're right that from a pure ""expected future value"" perspective, it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible (including not taking the next year's loan). The new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible. The crucial point in your case, which isn't true for many people, is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly. A few points to set against that, that you might want to consider: Not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect, e.g. if the economy does badly, you have health problems, you take a career break for any reason. If that happens, you would end up not being forced to pay it off, so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily. The money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well. Not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it, e.g. for a house deposit. Having more free cash could increase your options, making it possible to buy a house earlier in life. Or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy, reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance. The savings from that could end up being more than the 6% interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate.","Opting for early repayment of UK student loans or avoiding further debt requires a tailored strategy, factoring in the unique loan interest rates and your financial situation. If your career prospects suggest a high income, paying off loans early can save money otherwise spent on accruing interest. Conversely, given the loans' income-contingent repayment plan and cancellation after a certain period, it may be financially savvy to allocate surplus funds towards higher-interest debt or investments, rather than accelerating loan repayments. Carefully analyze your financial goals, interest rates, and potential investment returns to determine the optimal course of action.",1
Should I purchase a whole life insurance policy? (I am close to retirement),"Disclaimer: I work in life insurance, but I am not an agent.   First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, ""7-8% a year compounded annually"".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.  But if a 25 year old asked this same question, depending on his purposes, I may suggest that a WL policy is in fact a good idea.","Purchasing a whole life insurance policy close to retirement requires a detailed assessment of your financial goals, estate planning needs, and existing retirement savings. Whole life policies can offer stable premiums, a death benefit, and a cash value component that grows over time, which might be appealing for legacy planning or if you're looking for additional avenues to pass wealth to your heirs. However, these policies tend to be expensive, especially when initiated later in life. If your primary goal is income protection for dependents, determining whether the premiums justify the benefits at your stage is crucial, considering other retirement assets and income sources might be more cost-effective.",1
Why are wire transfers and other financial services in Canada so much more expensive than in Europe?,"I don't believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in Canada, their costs are no higher than other countries (and lower than many).  Wires seem to be an area where the Canadian banks have decided people don't comparison shop, so it's not a competitive advantage to offer a better price. The rates you quoted are on the low side: $80 for a largish international wire is not unusual, and HSBC charges up to $150! There are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in Canada. If the recipient banks at the same bank, it's possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account (I've never been charged for this).  The transfer is immediate.  But it couldn't be done online, last time I checked. For transfers where you don't know the recipients bank account, you can pay online with Interac E-Transfers, offered by most Canadian banks.  It's basically e-mailing money.  It usually costs $1 to $1.50 per transfer, and has limits on how much you can send per day/week. Each of the banks also have a bill-pay service, but unlike similar services in the US (where they mail a paper check if the recipient isn't on their system), each Canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees (mostly utilities, governments, major stores).","Financial services, including wire transfers, tend to be more expensive in Canada than in Europe primarily due to competition, market structure, and regulatory factors. Europe's financial market is highly competitive with a large number of banks and financial institutions spanning across countries, encouraged by the EU's policies aimed at promoting competition and integration. This competition drives down costs for consumers. On the other hand, Canada's banking system is more concentrated, with a few major banks dominating the market, leading to less competitive pressure to lower fees. Additionally, regulatory differences can affect the cost structure of financial services, making transactions like wire transfers more expensive in Canada.",1
Stochastic Oscillator for Financial Analysis,"While trading in stochastic I've understood, one needs reference (SMA/EMA/Bolinger Band and even RSI) to verify trade prior entering it. Stochastic is nothing to do with price or volume it is about speed. Adjusting K% has ability to turn you from Day trader to -> swing trader to -> long term investor. So you adjust your k% according to chart time-frame. Stochastic setup for 1 min, 5 min ,15, 30, 60 min, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly are all different. If you try hopping from one time-frame to another just because it is below oversold or above overbought region with same K%, you may get confused. Worst you may not square-off your loss making trade. And rather not use excel; charts gives better visual for oscillators.","The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator used in financial analysis to predict price reversals and assess the strength of an asset's current price relative to its price range over a specific period. This tool operates on the principle that prices tend to close near their highs in bullish markets and near their lows in bearish markets. It generates two lines, %K and %D, which oscillate between 0 and 100 to signal overbought or oversold conditions. Traders often consider a reading above 80 as overbought and below 20 as oversold, looking for crossovers between the two lines as potential buy or sell signals.",1
How to motivate young people to save money,"I recommend pulling up a retirement calculator and having an honest conversation about how long term savings works, and the power of compound interest. Just by playing around with the sliders on an online calculator, you can demonstrate how the early years are the most important. Depending on how much they make now and are considering saving, delaying 5-10 years can easily leave 6-7 figures on the table. If it's specifically a child or close family member, I recommend pulling up your retirement account. Talk with them about how you managed it, and how much you were putting in. Perhaps show them how much is the principal and how much is interest. If you did well, tell them how. If you didn't do as well as you liked, tell them what you would have done differently. Finally, discuss a bit of psychology. Even if they don't have a professional job and are making minimum wage, getting into the habit of saving makes it easier when they eventually make more. A couple of dollars a month isn't much, but getting into the habit makes it easier to save a couple hundred dollars a month later on.","Motivating young people to save money is effectively achieved by highlighting the immediate benefits of financial security and freedom it brings rather than focusing solely on long-term goals, such as retirement, which may seem too distant. By encouraging them to set achievable, short-term objectives, such as saving for a vacation, a gadget, or an emergency fund, they can tangibly experience the rewards of their savings efforts. Additionally, leveraging the power of digital tools and apps that simplify saving and investing can make the process more engaging. Introducing concepts like compounding interest helps demonstrate how their money can grow over time, illustrating that saving can be both financially rewarding and empowering.",2
How quickly will the funds be available when depositing credit card checks?,"For those who don't know, credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you.  When you fill them out and spend them, you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account.  You should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions. That having been said, when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them, it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds.  They want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored.  If your teller doesn't know the answer to that question, you'll need to find someone at the bank who does.  If you don't like the answer they give you, you'll need to find another bank. I would think that if the credit card is from Chase, and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a Chase checking account, they should be able to do that instantly.  However, bank policy doesn't always make sense.","When you deposit credit card checks, generally known as convenience checks, the funds availability can vary based on your bank's policies and the amount deposited. It's common for a portion of the funds to be available within one to two business days, with the remaining amount clearing within 7-10 days. This delay is due to the bank needing to verify the funds with the credit card company. Keep in mind, depositing a credit card check means you're borrowing from your credit line, which involves fees and interest, so consider this option carefully.",1
Self assessment expenses - billing date or payment date?,"Unless you're running a self-employed business with a significant turnover (more than £150k), you are entitled to use cash basis accounting for your tax return, which means you would put the date of transactions as the payment date rather than the billing date or the date a debt is incurred. For payments which have a lag, e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days, you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates, e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect. You can pick one as long as you're consistent: You can choose how you record when money is received or    paid (eg the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque   is written) but you must use the same method each tax year.","For self-assessment tax purposes, expenses are generally recognized based on the date they were incurred rather than the date of payment. This means that the relevant concern for tax deductions is when the liability for the expense was established, reflecting the accrual accounting method. This approach helps ensure that expenses are matched with the income they helped generate within the same tax period, providing a more accurate picture of your financial performance. However, it's crucial to maintain thorough documentation of both the billing and payment dates for all expenses, as this information can be critical for tax reporting and potential audits.",1
How much of my capital should I spend on subscribing to a stock research company?,"To complement farnsy's answer, I want to warn people against market prediction scams.

They are trading a few cents of Amazon server time for 3% of your capital.","The ideal amount to spend on a stock research company subscription depends on your investment portfolio size and strategy, but a general guideline is to limit such expenses to a small percentage of your expected annual returns or overall investment income, often suggested not to exceed 0.5% of your invested capital. For smaller portfolios, it's crucial to weigh the cost against free resources and lower-cost alternatives to ensure the expense doesn't significantly erode your potential profits. Opting for a service that aligns well with your investment approach and offers value beyond basic information can maximize the return on this investment.",1
Do “Instant Approved” credit card inquires appear on credit report?,"It is not delayed and if it didn't show yet - will not show on that agency's credit report. However, you may find it on another agency's report. There are three major agencies, and creditors don't always check all of them (each inquiry costs them money).","Yes, ""Instant Approved"" credit card inquiries do appear on your credit report as a hard inquiry. When you apply for a credit card and receive an instant decision, the credit card issuer has conducted a hard pull on your credit report to assess your creditworthiness. This hard inquiry can slightly lower your credit score and will typically remain on your credit report for two years. However, the impact is usually minimal and can be offset by responsible credit management, such as making timely payments and maintaining low credit card balances.",3
How much lump sum investment in stocks would be needed to yield a target stable monthly income?,"If your requirements are hard (must have $1000/month, must have the same or bigger in capital at the end), stocks are a poor choice of investment. However, in many cases, people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns. You also do not mention inflation, which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years. If we make some simplifying assumptions, you want to generate $12,000 a year. You can realistically expect the (whole) stock market, long term (i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years), to return approximately 4 - 5% after factoring in inflation. That means an investment of $240,000 - $300,000 (the math is simplified somewhat here). If you don't care about inflation, you can up the percentage rather somewhat. According to this article, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.31% from 1928 through 2010 (not factoring in inflation), which would require an investment of approximately $106,100. But! This opens you up to substantial risk. The stock market may go down 30% this year! According to the above article, the S&P returned only 3.54% from 2001 to 2010. Long-term, it goes up, but your investment case is really unsuited to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements. You may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds, or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks. Alternatively, you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes. Treasury notes are all but guaranteed, but with a lousy rate of return. Heck, you could consider a GIC (that may be Canada-only) or even a savings account. There's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity, though almost everyone will advise against such. Personally, I'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70% bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period. Something like ING Direct's Streetwise Balanced Income Portfolio, if you were in Canada. It substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk. I can't honestly say what the expected return there is; at this point, it's returned 4% per year (before inflation), but has been around only since the beginning of 2008. And to be clear, this is absolutely not free of risk.","To determine the lump sum investment needed to yield a target stable monthly income from stocks, one needs to consider the expected annual dividend yield and divide the annual income goal by that yield percentage. For example, if aiming for a monthly income of $1,000 ($12,000 annually) and expecting an average dividend yield of 4%, the lump sum investment required would be $300,000 ($12,000 / 0.04). However, remember that stock investments carry risks, including dividend variability and capital value fluctuation, so it's crucial to assess risk tolerance and consider diversification to help manage these factors.",1
Starting off as an investor,"You've asked eleven different questions here.  Therefore, The first thing I'd recommend is this: Don't panic. Seek answers to your questions systematically, one at a time.  Search this site (and others) to see if there are answers to some of them.  You're in good shape if for no other reason than you're asking these when you're young. Investing and saving are great things to do, but you also have time going for you.  I recommend that you use your ""other eight hours per day"" to build up other income streams.  That potentially will get you far more than a 2% deposit. Any investment can be risky or safe.  It depends on both your personal context and that of the larger economy.  The best answers will come from your own research and from your advisors (since they will be able to see where you are financially, and in life).","Starting off as an investor requires a clear investment goal, understanding of your risk tolerance, and knowledge of the basic investment options like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. It's crucial to diversify your investments to spread risk and to consider low-cost index funds for a broad market exposure. Starting early and investing consistently over time, taking advantage of compound interest, is key to building wealth. Additionally, stay informed about the financial markets and review your investment portfolio regularly to align with your financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that suits your specific situation.",1
"As a 22-year-old, how risky should I be with my 401(k) investments?","At twenty-two, you can have anywhere between 100%-70% of your securities portfolio in equities. It is reasonable to start at 100% and reduce over time.  The one thing that I would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70% stocks/30% bonds.  You should NEVER have more than 30% bonds.  Why?  Because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100% bonds and will give a higher return.  Absent some market timing strategy (which as an amateur investor, you should absolutely avoid) or some complicated balancing scheme, there is never a reason to be at more than 30% bonds.   A 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100% bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix, it is actually riskier.  Why?  Because sometimes bonds fall.  And when they do, stocks generally gain.  And vice versa.  Because of this behavior, the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50% or 100% bonds.   Does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70%?  No.  If your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds, it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70%.  The problem is that when you drop stocks below 70%, you should drop bonds below 30% as well.  So you keep the stock to bond ratio at 7:3.   If you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix, then you should move into cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination.  But at twenty-two, you don't really need more safety.   At twenty-two, the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund.  This should be able to handle six months of expenses without income.  I recommend making it equal to six months of your income.  The reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses.  Also, you can save six months of income at twenty-two.   Are you going to stay where you are for the next five years?  At twenty-two, the answer is almost certainly no.  But the standard is the five year time frame.  If you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work, then no.  If you stay somewhere at least five years, then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses.  Less than five years, the reverse is true.  So you should probably rent now.   You can max out your 401k and IRA now.  Doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty-seven.  And perhaps more importantly, it helps keep your spending down.  The less you do spend, the less you will feel that you need to spend.   Once you fill your emergency fund, start building savings for a house.  I would consider putting them in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  A REIT will tend to track real estate.  Since you want to buy real estate with the results, this is its own kind of safety.  It fell in value?  Houses are probably cheap.  Houses increasing in price rapidly?  A REIT is probably growing by leaps and bounds.  You do this outside your retirement accounts, as you want to be able to access it without penalty.","At 22, assuming a long-term investment horizon until retirement, you can afford to adopt a relatively high-risk strategy for your 401(k). Young investors have the advantage of time, allowing them to ride out market volatility and benefit from the potentially higher returns of riskier investments, such as stocks or stock-focused mutual funds. However, it's crucial to align your investment choices with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Diversifying your portfolio can also mitigate risk. Over time, as you move closer to retirement, gradually shifting to a more conservative investment mix can help protect your gains.",1
How much should a new graduate with new job put towards a car?,"In a very similar situation as yours, I bought a used motorcycle for $3000. It was still reasonably new, very reliable, and with California weather, you can use it year-round. It reduced my time in traffic, and it had very low fuel and maintenance costs. The biggest expense was tires. The biggest pitfall in buying a motorcycle is auto-insurance. Do your research and ask for quotes from your broker before even considering a particular model of bike. When I decided that my finances justified a new motorcycle, I was surprised that full collision coverage cost about $3000/year on a lower powered bike that had a bad accident record because it appealed to new riders. I got a much more powerful bike that appealed to more experienced riders and the premium was only $500/year. Is this answer not what you were looking for? Spend as little as you can on a 4-6 year old car. Drive it until you can save enough cash to buy the one you really want. I'm currently driving a 2007 Corolla, and I'm waiting until I can get a new civic turbo with a manual transmission to replace it. (They currently only offer them with a CVT, but next fall they'll have them with the MT, so I'm probably 2 1/2 years out from buying one used.)","As a Wealth Management advisor, I recommend new graduates allocate no more than 20% of their monthly net income towards purchasing a car. This figure should encompass the total car payment including insurance, fuel, maintenance, and any potential loan interest. It's essential to ensure this expense does not impede the ability to meet other financial obligations or hinder the opportunity to save and invest for future goals. Opting for a reliable, used vehicle can further stretch the value of this investment, providing more financial flexibility in these formative years of career building.",1
"Books, Videos, Tutorials to learn about different investment options in the financial domain","Those are some very broad questions and I don't think I can answer them completely, but I will add what I can. Barron's Finance and Investment Handbook is the best reference book I have found. It provides a basic description/definition for every type of investment available. It covers stocks, preferred stocks, various forms of bonds as well as mortgage pools and other exotic instruments. It has a comprehensive dictionary of finance terms as well. I would definitely recommend getting it.  The question about how people invest today is a huge one. There are people who simply put a monthly amount into a mutual fund and simply do that until retirement on one side and professional day traders who move in and out of stocks or commodities on a daily basis on the other.","To gain a comprehensive understanding of various investment options in the financial domain, consider exploring ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham, a classic book that offers insights into value investing. For a broader perspective on behavioral finance, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman is invaluable. Online platforms like Coursera and Udemy offer a variety of courses taught by industry experts, covering topics from stock market basics to complex investment strategies. Additionally, YouTube channels like Graham Stephan and The Plain Bagel provide accessible tutorials and discussions on investment concepts, trends, and strategies, suitable for both beginners and seasoned investors.",2
What tax advantage should I keep an eye for if I am going to relocate?,"Depends. If you can choose where to relocate to, then I second the ""no income tax"" states. But even of these chose wisely, some have no income taxes at all, others have taxes on some kinds of income. Some don't have neither individual nor corporate taxes, some tax businesses in some ways. Some compensate with higher property taxes, others compensate with higher sales taxes. On the other hand, you might prefer states with income taxes but no sales taxes. It can happen if your current income is going to be low, but you'll be spending your savings. If you don't have a choice (for example, your employer wants you to move closer to their office), then you're more limited. Still, you can use the tax break on moving expenses (read the fine print, there are certain employment requirements), and play with the state taxes (if you're moving to a state with less/no taxes - move earlier, if its the other way - move later). Check out for cities that have income taxes. In some states it cannot happen by law (for example, in California only the state is allowed to collect income taxes), in others it is very common (Ohio comes to mind). Many things to consider in New York. New York City has its own income tax (as well as Yonkers, as far as I remember these are the only ones in the State of New York). So if you want to save on taxes in NYS but live close to the city, consider White Plains etc. If you work in NYC its moot, you're going to pay city taxes anyway. That is also true if you live in NJ but work in the city, so tax-wise it may be more efficient not to live across state lines from your place of work.","When considering relocation, especially for tax advantages, focus on the overall tax environment of the potential new location. Look for states with no income tax (e.g., Florida, Texas, Nevada), low property taxes, and favorable capital gains tax rates. Additionally, examine estate and inheritance tax policies, as some states impose their own taxes on top of federal estate taxes. Certain locales offer incentives for new residents, including tax breaks for retirees, entrepreneurs, or specific industries. Evaluating these factors holistically will help identify locations that align with your financial goals, potentially enhancing your tax efficiency and preserving more of your wealth.",1
Why are there so many stock exchanges in the world?,"Stock exchanges have been undergoing a period of consolidation for the past hundred years for the exact reasons you mentioned. The existence of digital trading, harmonized laws and regulations, and fewer relevant currencies have made it more practical for mergers and acquisitions between exchanges. Stock exchanges are most often times private companies that compete with other exchanges, so that also promotes the existence of many exchanges.","There are numerous stock exchanges worldwide due to various factors, including geopolitical boundaries, economic strategies, the need for marketplaces to match local investor preferences with local enterprises, and the diversification of economic policies. Each country typically establishes its own exchange to promote domestic companies and accommodate local regulatory and legal frameworks, thereby fostering economic growth. Furthermore, technological advancements have made access to global markets easier, encouraging the proliferation of exchanges to cater to different sectors, time zones, and currencies, thereby enhancing global investment opportunities and allowing investors to diversify their portfolios across multiple markets.",1
Why are daily rebalanced inverse/leveraged ETFs bad for long term investing?,"Fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective.  For example, lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20% in bonds.  Because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9% in bonds at the end of the trading day.  The fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds.   Rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution, typically once per year, without selling the fund.  And really any trading within the fun could do the same. In the case you cite the verbiage is confusing.  Often times I wonder if the author knows less then the reader.  It might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out, and the author did not write correctly. I agree that the ETFs cited are suitable for short term traders.  However, that is because, traditionaly, the market has increased in value over the long term.  If you bet it will go down over the long term, you are almost certain to lose money. Like you, I cannot figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders.  If the ETFs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year, that is worth mentioning, but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders.   Secondly, I don't think these funds are doing true rebalancing.  They might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome, but that really isn't rebalancing.   It seems the author is confused.","Daily rebalanced inverse and leveraged ETFs are undesirable for long-term investing primarily because they are designed to achieve their leverage or inverse objectives on a daily basis, which leads to compounding effects that can greatly diverge from the expected long-term returns of the underlying asset. Over time, the impact of daily volatility and the costs associated with maintaining leverage or inverse positions erode returns, making them unsuitable for investors with a long-term horizon. These ETFs are typically more appropriate for professional traders or highly informed individuals who actively manage and monitor short-term market movements.",1
Should you keep your stocks if you are too late to sell?,"The stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock's current profitability and prospects, but is also based on prediction of how the stock's prospects might change in the future. In almost every case, there are professional investors analysing the stock's future prospects and considering whether it's over or under values for its current price. However even professionals can be totally wrong.  If you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time, then you might be (if you're right) equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not. If you don't think you have a good understanding about the stock, then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding. Otherwise, you are simply taking a punt. If you know of another stock that has better prospects, then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse.  But also bear in mind that (in my understanding) research has shown that, on average, people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection, and more stock trades means more brokerage (which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market).","If you find yourself 'too late to sell' your stocks during a downturn, it's essential to evaluate the long-term potential of your investments rather than making hasty decisions. Historically, the stock market has shown resilience over time, often recovering and providing positive returns to those who hold onto fundamentally strong stocks. Selling in panic can lock in losses, so consider holding onto your investments if they are in well-established companies with solid growth prospects. However, continuously assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as necessary.",1

Tax rules for United States citizens living in the US but being paid from outside the US,"You can and are supposed to report self-employment income on Schedule C (or C-EZ if eligible, which a programmer likely is) even when the payer isn't required to give you 1099-MISC (or 1099-K for a payment network now). From there, after deducting permitted expenses, it flows to 1040 (for income tax) and Schedule SE (for self-employment tax). See https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed for some basics and lots of useful links. If this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $1000, you may need to make quarterly estimated payments (OR if you also have a 'day job' have that employer increase your withholding) to avoid an underpayment penalty. But if this is the first year you have significant self-employment income (or other taxable but unwithheld income like realized capital gains) and your economic/tax situation is otherwise unchanged -- i.e. you have the same (or more) payroll income with the same (or more) withholding -- then there is a 'safe harbor': if your withholding plus estimated payments this year is too low to pay this year's tax but it is enough to pay last year's tax you escape the penalty. (You still need to pay the tax due, of course, so keep the funds available for that.) At the end of the first year when you prepare your return you will see how the numbers work out and can more easily do a good estimate for the following year(s). A single-member LLC or 'S' corp is usually disregarded for tax purposes, although you can elect otherwise, while a (traditional) 'C' corp is more complicated and AIUI out-of-scope for this Stack; see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/business-structures for more.","As a U.S. citizen living in the United States but receiving payment from outside the U.S., you are subject to U.S. income tax on your global income, including earnings from abroad. The U.S. tax system operates on a worldwide income basis for its citizens, meaning all income regardless of its source is potentially taxable. However, mechanisms like the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) can mitigate double taxation, allowing you to exclude a portion of your foreign earnings from U.S. tax or credit taxes paid to other countries against your U.S. tax liability. It's essential to report foreign income on your tax return, considering these options to optimize your tax situation.",1
What are my investment options in real estate?,"I compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends (hard to find, however, managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard).  After discussing with many in the real estate world, I counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 - 8% on real estate after taxes.  This does not include anything else like Dilip mentions (maintenance, insurance, etc).  For those who want to avoid that route, you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or REIT funds like Dilip mentions.  However, they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this. In terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds, think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed.  We won't outgrow our need for real estate, but we won't outgrow our need for food or tangible goods either.  You can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund. Finally, one of your best investments is your career field - software.  Do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start-up (it's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set) or create a site which generates passive revenue (again, not that hard).  One software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation (think of a smart phone application that you build once, yet continues to generate revenue).  This was right before the crash, and after it, everyone talked about another ""lost decade.""  While it does require extra work initially, like all things software related, you'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications - meaning your first one may be the most difficult. All it takes in this case is one really good idea ...","As a Wealth Management advisor, your options in real estate investment are varied and adaptable to different risk and capital profiles. You can directly purchase residential or commercial properties, offering potential rental yield and capital appreciation.

Additionally, real estate limited partnerships (RELPs) and crowdfunding platforms offer ways to invest in real estate ventures with less capital and direct management responsibility, though they might carry higher risks and less liquidity compared to direct ownership and REITs.",1
Does the Black-Scholes Model apply to American Style options?,"A minor tangent. One can claim the S&P has a mean return of say 10%, and standard deviation of say 14% or so, but when you run with that, you find that the actual returns aren't such a great fit to the standard bell curve. Market anomalies producing the ""100-year flood"" far more often than predicted over even a 20 year period. This just means that the model doesn't reflect reality at the tails, even if the +/- 2 standard deviations look pretty. This goes for the Black-Sholes (I almost abbreviated it to initials, then thought better, I actually like the model) as well. The distinction between American and European is small enough that the precision of the model is wider than the difference of these two option styles. I believe if you look at the model and actual pricing, you can determine the volatility of a given stock by using prices around the strike price, but when you then model the well out of money options, you often find the market creating its own valuation.","The Black-Scholes model, primarily designed for European options, does not straightforwardly apply to American style options due to the latter's feature allowing early exercise before expiration. While Black-Scholes can be adapted to approximate prices for American options, especially for those that don't pay dividends, its direct application may not accurately reflect the potential value derived from the early exercise option inherent to American-style contracts. For precise pricing of American options, other models, like the Binomial Model or the Bjerksund-Stensland model, are typically preferred as they can more accurately account for the early exercise feature.",1
Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for the tax consequences of selling investments to buy a house?,"If you need less than $125k for the downpayment, I recommend you convert your mutual fund shares to their ETF counterparts tax-free: Can I convert conventional Vanguard mutual fund shares to Vanguard   ETFs? Shareholders of Vanguard stock index funds that offer Vanguard ETFs   may convert their conventional shares to Vanguard ETFs of the same   fund. This conversion is generally tax-free, although some brokerage   firms may be unable to convert fractional shares, which could result   in a modest taxable gain. (Four of our bond ETFs—Total Bond Market,   Short-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, and Long-Term Bond—do not   allow the conversion of bond index fund shares to bond ETF shares of   the same fund; the other eight Vanguard bond ETFs allow conversions.)

For more information, contact your   brokerage firm, or call 866-499-8473. Once you convert from conventional shares to Vanguard ETFs, you cannot   convert back to conventional shares. Also, conventional shares held   through a 401(k) account cannot be converted to Vanguard ETFs. https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsVIPERWhatAreVIPERSharesJSP.jsp Withdraw the money you need as a margin loan, buy the house, get a second mortgage of $125k, take the proceeds from the second mortgage and pay back the margin loan. Even if you have short term credit funds, it'd still be wiser to lever up the house completely as long as you're not overpaying or in a bubble area, considering your ample personal investments and the combined rate of return of the house and the funds exceeding the mortgage interest rate.  Also, mortgage interest is tax deductible while margin interest isn't, pushing the net return even higher. $125k Generally, I recommend this figure to you because the biggest S&P collapse since the recession took off about 50% from the top.  If you borrow $125k on margin, and the total value of the funds drop 50%, you shouldn't suffer margin calls. I assumed that you were more or less invested in the S&P on average (as most modern ""asset allocations"" basically recommend a back-door S&P as a mix of credit assets, managed futures, and small caps average the S&P). Second mortgage Yes, you will have two loans that you're paying interest on. You've traded having less invested in securities & a capital gains tax bill for more liabilities, interest payments, interest deductions, more invested in securities, a higher combined rate of return. If you have $500k set aside in securities and want $500k in real estate, this is more than safe for you as you will most likely have a combined rate of return of ~5% on $500k with interest on $500k at ~3.5%.  If you're in small cap value, you'll probably be grossing ~15% on $500k. You definitely need to secure your labor income with supplementary insurance.  Start a new question if you need a model for that. Secure real estate with securities A local bank would be more likely to do this than a major one, but if you secure the house with the investment account with special provisions like giving them copies of your monthly statements, etc, you might even get a lower rate on your mortgage considering how over-secured the loan would be. You might even be able to wrap it up without a down payment in one loan if it's still legal.  Mortgage regulations have changed a lot since the housing crash.","To prepare for the tax consequences of selling investments to buy a house, consider the timing of the sale and your overall investment strategy. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than short-term gains, so holding investments for over a year before selling can lead to lower tax rates.

Question about being a resident,"This sort of involves personal finance, and sort of not. But it's an interesting question, so let's call it on topic? Short answer: yes.

For tax purposes, the first year you move to a new state you need to file part-time resident returns in your previous and current state of residency","As a Wealth Management advisor, it's important to consider the tax implications and asset protection strategies pertinent to your residency. Residency status can significantly impact your tax liabilities, including income and estate taxes, and your ability to leverage local investment opportunities.

Weekly budgets based on (a variable) monthly budget,"If you know, approximately, the minimum he would get in a month, his budget should be planned based on this amount. In months where he gets more than this, the excess should be put aside. In really bad months where the income drops below the expected minimum, he can use the money put aside. After a year of putting money aside, he can plan to use and budget this for any other expenses.","When advising clients on managing a variable monthly budget through weekly allocations, the key is flexibility and foresight. Start by calculating the average monthly income over the past 6-12 months to establish a baseline. Divide this average into weeks, allowing for slight adjustments to account for months with higher or lower expected income. Emphasize setting aside a portion for savings and unexpected expenses in each weekly budget. This strategy not only ensures more consistent financial management but also encourages regular assessment and adjustment, fostering a proactive approach to both predictable and unforeseen financial changes.",1
How do annual risks translate into long-term risks?,"The short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years. For independent, identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally. So for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m = 12 annualises the volatility.  It should be the same for all time scales.  However, note the discussion here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178 Scaling volatility [like this] only is mathematically correct when the   underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion which   implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are   normally distributed. Particularly the comment: ""its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such ""long-term"" volatility."" Now, a demonstration.  I have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3% and standard deviation = 2, so the annualised volatility should be Sqrt(12) * 2 = 6.9282.   Calculating annualised volatility for return sequences of various lengths (3, 6, 12, 60 months etc.) reveals an inaccuracy for shorter sequences.  The five-year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure (6.9282), and, as the commenter noted ""volatility is [slightly] overestimated when scaled over long periods of time"". Annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths  Edit re. comment Reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much.  For instance, comparing some data I have handy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR).  The return differences are somewhat smoothed, 0.1% each month, 0.25% every third month.  More erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility.","Annual risks, such as market volatility, inflation, and economic downturns, can compound over time, significantly affecting long-term investment outcomes. While short-term risks might cause immediate fluctuations in portfolio value, their persistence or recurrence can erode capital, reduce compound growth, and deviate from long-term financial goals. This translation from short to long-term risk underscores the importance of a diversified and strategically rebalanced portfolio, designed to mitigate these cumulative effects and preserve capital for future growth. Understanding and managing these annual risks are crucial for maintaining a steady course towards long-term investment objectives.",1
Fractional Reserve Banking and Insolvency,"It certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency.  And yes, if the bank makes some bad loans, it can magnify the problem. Generally, this does not happen, though.  Remember that banks usually have lots of customers, and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day, so there is usually enough on-hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity, regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding. Banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day.  They also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default.  A bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit-making activity (e.g. issuing loans), and satisfying its account holders. In the event of a major withdrawl demand, there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency. There are regulations that specify a Reserve Requirement.  The bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand, so they can't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once.  Regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation. If a bank does run into trouble, it can take out a short-term loan.  Either from another bank, or from the central bank (e.g. the US Federal Reserve).  Banks don't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do, so if they are regularly borrowing money, they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly. If all else fails and the bank can't meet its obligations (e.g. the Fed loan fell through), the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid.  In the US, this is what the FDIC is for.  Worst case, the bank goes under, but your money is safe. These protections have worked pretty well for many decades.  However, during the recent financial crisis, all three of these protections were under heavy strain.  So, one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing.  These tests showed that some banks didn't have enough money in reserve.  (Not long after, banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital.) Keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money (loan it out, invest it, etc), the current financial landscape would change considerably.","Fractional reserve banking is a system where banks are required to keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve but can lend out the remainder. While this model is fundamental for creating credit and stimulating economic growth, it carries the risk of insolvency. If many depositors simultaneously decide to withdraw their money—a scenario commonly referred to as a 'bank run'—a bank might not have enough liquid assets to meet these demands, leading to insolvency. This risk is mitigated by central banks, which can act as lenders of last resort, and deposit insurance schemes that protect depositors' funds up to a certain limit.",1
What part of buying a house would make my net worth go down?,"You can look at buying a house as being a long term investment in not paying rent.   In the short time there are costs to buying (legal, taxes, etc).   This depends on only buying house of the size/location you need e.g. no better then what you would have rented. House buying tent to work out best when there is high inflation, as the rent you would otherwise be paying goes up with  inflation – provided you can live with the short term pain of high interest rates.","When buying a house, your net worth initially goes down due to the expenses associated with the purchase beyond the price of the property itself. These include closing costs, such as loan origination fees, appraisal fees, title searches, title insurance, and various other settlement fees, which can amount to 2-5% of the home’s purchase price. Additional immediate expenses could also include necessary repairs, renovations, and moving costs, not initially recovered through equity. Therefore, while the long-term investment in property generally appreciates, these upfront costs reduce your liquid assets, temporarily lowering your net worth.",1
How to make money from a downward European market?,"If you want to make money while European equities markets are crashing and the Euro itself is devaluing: None of these strategies are to be taken lightly. All involve risk. There are probably numerous ways that you can lose even though it seems like you should win. Transaction fees could eat your profits, especially if you have only a small amount of capital to invest with. The worst part is that they all involve timing. If you think the crash is coming next week, you could, say, buy a bunch of puts. But if the crash doesn't come for another 6 months, all of your puts are going to expire worthless and you've lost all of your capital. Even worse, if you sell short an index ETF this week in advance of next week's impending crash, and some rescue package arrives over the weekend, equity prices could spike at the beginning of the week and you'd be screwed.","To make money from a downward European market, consider employing a strategy such as short selling, where you borrow shares to sell at a current high price and then buy them back later at a lower price, hence profiting from the price difference. Additionally, investing in inverse ETFs that gain when the market drops can be lucrative. Options trading, specifically buying put options, allows you to speculate on the decline of market prices. However, each strategy comes with significant risk and requires a thorough understanding of the market and the instruments. Therefore, adept risk management and market analysis are crucial.",1
Is it inadvisable to leave a Roth IRA to charity upon death?,"You need to keep in mind that there's an exemption amount of more than $5M (five million) dollars for estate tax. Unless you used all of it for gifts during your life time, it will more than cover all of your $70K estate, so there's no need in any additional planning. As to Roth vs Traditional IRA - if you want to leave something to your siblings, leave them the Roth. Why would you give the taxable income to your siblings when you can give them the nontaxable one? Charities are tax exempt anyway.","Leaving a Roth IRA to a charity upon death is actually a very strategic move for those who are philanthropically inclined. Since charities are tax-exempt entities, the Roth IRA proceeds would pass to them without any tax consequences, making full use of the account's value. Furthermore, this decision could potentially simplify the estate, offering a direct transfer of assets to the chosen charity. However, if leaving a legacy to heirs alongside charitable giving is a priority, consider the implications on the total estate plan and explore balancing both objectives through different assets.",1
How to register LLC in the US from India? [duplicate],"Wyoming is a good state for this. It is inexpensive and annual compliance is minimal. Although Delaware has the best advertising campaign, so people know about it, the reality is  that there are over 50 states/jurisdictions in the United States with their own competitive incorporation laws to attract investment (as well as their own legislative bodies that change those laws), so you just have to read the laws to find a state that is favorable for you. What I mean is that whatever Delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws, has been mimicked and done even better by other states by this point in time. And regarding Delaware's Chancery Court, all other states in the union can also lean on Delaware case law, so this perk is not unique to Delaware. Wyoming is cheaper than Delaware for nominal presence in the United States, requires less information then Delaware, and is also tax free. A ""registered agent"" can get you set up and you can find one to help you with the address dilemma. This should only cost $99 - $200 over the state fees. An LLC does not need to have an address in the United States, but many registered agents will let you use their address, just ask. Many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade. Many don't require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments. But if you do need this, then opening a bank account in the United States will be more difficult. Again, the registered agent or lawyer can get a Tax Identification Number for you from the IRS, and this will be necessary to open a US bank account.  But it is more likely that you will need an employee or nominee director in the United States to go in person to a bank and open an account. This person needs to be mentioned in the Operating Agreement or other official form on the incorporation documents. They will simply walk into a bank with your articles of incorporation and operating agreement showing that they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and open a bank account. They then resign, and this is a private document between the LLC and the employee. But you will be able to receive and accept payments and access the global financial system now. A lot of multinational entities set up subsidiaries in a number of countries this way.","To register an LLC in the US from India, you should start by selecting a state for registration since LLC regulations vary by state. Hiring a reliable registered agent in that state is mandatory as they will handle legal documents on your behalf. Next, choose a unique name for your LLC adhering to the state's naming requirements. File the Articles of Organization with the chosen state's business filing agency and pay the required filing fee. Obtain an EIN from the IRS for tax purposes. Finally, draft an operating agreement to outline the ownership and operating procedures, although not all states require this.",1
Do I have to repay the First-Time Homebuyers tax credit if I refinance?,"No. As long as you live in the house for 3 years, it's yours to keep. Financing has nothing to do with that.","No, you generally do not have to repay the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit if you refinance your home. This tax credit was designed to help first-time buyers in the housing market and does not need to be repaid simply due to refinancing. However, it's important to remember that you must maintain the property as your primary residence for at least three years after the purchase; otherwise, you might have to repay the credit. Refinancing does not change this residency requirement. Always verify specific terms related to your credit and consult with a tax professional for your situation.",1
"Paid cash for a car, but dealer wants to change price","Let me get this straight. I would stand my ground. Your son negotiated in good faith. Either they messed up, or they are dishonest. Either way your son wasn't the one supposed to know all the internal rules. I don't think it matters if they cashed the check or not. I would tell them if they have cashed it, that is even more evidence the deal was finalized. But even if they they didn't cash it, it only proves they are very disorganized. If for some reason your son feels forced to redo the deal, have him start the negotiations way below the price that was agreed to.  If the deal for some strange reason gets voided don't let him agree to some sort of restocking fee.","If you've already paid cash for a car and the dealer is attempting to change the price, it's crucial to assert your rights. Generally, once a sales contract is signed and payment is made, the terms are legally binding on both parties. You should gather all documentation related to the transaction, including the sales contract, payment records, and any communication with the dealer. Consult with a legal professional to understand your position clearly. It's advisable to also contact consumer protection agencies in your area as they can offer guidance and, if necessary, intervene on your behalf. Dealer attempts to alter a finalized deal post-payment typically lack legal standing without just cause or mutual agreement to contract modifications.",1
Do people tend to spend less when using cash than credit cards?,"Psychology Today had an interesting article from July 11, 2016, in which they go through the psychological aspects of using cash vs. a credit card. This article cites a 2008 paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied that found: “the more transparent the payment outflow, the greater the aversion to spending or higher the ‘pain of paying’ …leading to less transparent payment modes such as credit cards and gift cards (vs. cash) being more easily spent or treated as play or ‘monopoly money.’” The article cites a number of other studies that are of interest on this topic as well.","Yes, people often tend to spend less when using cash compared to credit cards. This spending behavior is attributed to the psychological pain or discomfort of parting with physical cash, making consumers more conscious of their spending choices. Credit cards, on the other hand, may psychologically feel less tangible, leading to easier spending and, in some cases, overspending due to delayed payment mechanisms and the out-of-sight, out-of-mind nature of electronic transactions. This difference in spending patterns highlights the importance of mindful budgeting and spending habits, regardless of the payment method chosen.",1
Any difference between buying a few shares of expensive stock or a bunch of cheap stock,"I was thinking that the value of the stock is the value of the stock...the actual number of shares really doesn't matter, but I'm not sure. You're correct.  Share price is meaningless.   Google is $700 per share, Apple is $100 per share, that doesn't say anything about either company and/or whether or not one is a better investment over the other. You should not evaluate an investment decision on price of a share.  Look at the books decide if the company is worth owning, then decide if it's worth owning at it's current price.","Yes, there is a difference between buying a few shares of expensive stock versus a bunch of cheap stock. Price per share doesn't inherently reflect the value or potential of a company. Expensive shares might represent established companies with lower volatility, potentially offering steady growth or dividends. On the other hand, cheaper stocks might belong to smaller or more volatile companies, possibly offering higher growth potential but with increased risk. The key consideration should be the quality of the investment, its alignment with your financial goals, and how it fits within the overall diversification of your portfolio.",1
What exactly is a “derivative”?,"A derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind, the kind “whose price depends on, or is derived from, another asset”.  This definition is from John Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives – a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this, you can easily find old copies for a few dollars. The first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument, like credits, or insurances, the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else, the mentioned asset. In most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset. In the sequel I give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to.  And first, let me point out that the definition is (marginally) wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets, nor do they have a price, like temperature, sunlight, or even your own life in the case of mortgages.  But before going in this list, let me go through the remaining points of your question. What is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative? As already noted, in most cases, a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort.  In a classical insurance contract, one party of the contract is an insurance company, but in the broader case of a derivative, that counterparty can be pretty anything: an insurance, a bank, a government, a large company, and most probably market makers. How is it really used, and how does this deviate from the first point? Briefly, how does is it affecting people, and how is it causing problems? An important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices.  Actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives, is that they are products whose price Y is a measurable function of one or several random variables X_1, X_2, … X_n on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price Y of the asset – this is what the depends on means in technical terms.  In the most favorable case, we obtain an easy formula linking Y to the X_is which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument. But in practice, it can be very difficult, if at all possible, to determine a price for derivatives. This has two implications: Persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market, in comparison to less advanced actors on the market. Organisation owning assets they cannot price cannot compute their bilan anymore, so that they cannot know for sure their financial situation. They are somehow playing roulette. But wait, if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk, which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation! How is this not a contradiction? Some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons.  For instance, many communes in France and Germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part, like in a classical credit, and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the Swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit.  (So, for a 25 years running credit of theis type, the price Y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 Xs, which are the uncertain prices for the Swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years.)  Some of these communes can be quite small, with 5.000 inhabitants, and needless to say, do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments, which in that special case led the court call the credit a swindling and to cancel the credit.  But what chain of events leads a 5.000 inhabitants city in France to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the Swiss frank?  After the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, it has begun to be very hard to organise funding, which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money.  So, the municipality needs a 25 years credit of 10.000.000 EUROS and goes to its communal bank.  The communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing.  So the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world, which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the Swiss frank will have in the 25 next years. Since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit.  Since the small bank has no idea, how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought, it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various communes it works with.  If we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks, we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank. We could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their bermudean snowballs. And we could also ask, if they are so influent that they eventually can manipulate the Swiss frank to secure an even higher profit.  But I will not go into this.  To the best of my understanding, the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot, with different actors, but I know this latter subject only by what I could read in French newspapers. So much for the “How is it causing problems?” part. What is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives (and   there meanings of course)? Answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by Hull, along with deriving some important mathematical principles.  And I will not copy these seven chapters here! How would someone get started dealing in derivatives (I'm playing a     realistic stock market simulation, so it doesn't matter if your     answer to this costs me money)? If you ask the question, I understand that you are not a professional, so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play I outlined above. I would recommand not doing this.  That said, if you have a good mathematical background and can program well, once you are confindent with the books of Hull and Joshi, you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies. Once you are confident with this, you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on arXiv.org. And once you are done with this, you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles. (And yes, even for the simplest options, they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run, even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better.) (indeed, I've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money) You know your weapons! :) Two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant.  This is a classical future contract, it can be modified in every imaginable way, usually by embedding options.  For instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days. Two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party.  The price is written today, as part of the contract.  (There is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something.)  Unlike the future contract, only one party can be obliged to do something, the other jas a right but no obligation. If you buy and option, your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset. This is the most familiar to anybody.  Credits can come in many different flavours, especially the formula to compute interests, or also embed options.  Common options are early settlement options or restructuration options. While this is not completely inutitive, the credit works like an insurance.  This is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money, that speculates that the ratio of creanciers going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit, just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit. This is like a mortgage on a financial institution.  Two parties agree that one will recive an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults. Here this is an explicit insurance against the unfortuante event, where a creancier goes bankrupt. One finds here more or less standard options on electricity. But electricity have delicious particularities as it can practically not be stored, and fallout is also (usually) avoided. As for classical options, these are insurances against price moves. A swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money, so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other — which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas. Typical example are fixed rate vs. EURIBOR on some given maturity, which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the EURIBOR, or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies, which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies decorrelating. Swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives.  The off-the-counter market features very imaginative, very customised insurance products. The most basic form is the insurance against drought, but you can image different dangers, and once you have it you can put it in options, in a swap, etc.  For instance, a restaurant with a terrasse could enter in a weather insurance, paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year. Actually, this list is virtually without limits!","A derivative is a financial contract whose value is based on (or ""derived"" from) the performance of an underlying asset, index, or rate. Common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. Derivatives are used for various purposes, including hedging against price movements, speculation on future price directions, and gaining access to otherwise inaccessible assets or markets. These instruments can be complex and carry significant risk, hence they are typically utilized by more sophisticated investors or institutions. Examples of derivatives include options, futures, forwards, and swaps.",1
What happens to the original funds when a certified bank check is not cashed?,"The answer probably varies with local law, and you haven't said where you're located. In most or all US states, it appears that after some statutory length of time, the bank would transfer the money to the state government, where it would be held indefinitely as ""unclaimed property"" in the name of the recipient (technically, the payee, the person to whom the check is made payable).  This process is called escheatment.  Most states publish a list of all unclaimed property, so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list, and realize they were entitled to the funds.  There would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state.   Usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money. As far as I know, there typically wouldn't be any way for you, the person who originated the payment, to collect the money after escheatment.  (Before escheatment, if you have the uncashed check in your possession, you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you.) I had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this, but a number of informal sources (found by Googling ""cashier check escheatment"") seem to agree that this is generally how it works.  Here is the web site for a law firm, saying that in California an uncashed cashier's check escheats to the state after 3 years. Until escheatment occurs, the recipient can cash the check at any time.  I don't think that cashier's checks become ""stale"" like personal checks do, and there isn't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you.","When a certified bank check is not cashed, the original funds remain in the issuer's bank until the check is presented for payment. These funds are set aside specifically for the check, hence cannot be used for other purposes by the issuer. However, certified checks do not expire, but if not cashed within a stipulated period (often 90-180 days), the issuer might need to request the bank to stop payment on the original check and possibly issue a new one. The process and policies may vary slightly by bank and jurisdiction.",1
Shares; are they really only for the rich/investors?,"Small purchases will have a disproportionate expense for commissions. Even a $5 trade fee is 5% on a $100 purchase. So on one hand, it's common to advise individuals just starting out to use mutual funds, specifically index funds with low fees. On the flip side, holding stocks has no annual fee, and if you are buying for the long term, you may still be better off with an eye toward cost, and learn over time.  In theory, an individual stands a better chance to beat the experts for a number of reasons, no shareholders to answer to, and the ability to purchase without any disclosure, among them. In reality, most investor lag the average by such a wide margin, they'd be best off indexing and staying in for the long term.","Shares, contrary to a common misconception, are not exclusively for the rich or seasoned investors. They represent an accessible investment avenue for people from various economic backgrounds. By investing in shares, individuals can buy a stake, however small, in a company, potentially earning dividends and benefiting from capital growth over time. Many online platforms and apps now allow investors to start with minimal amounts, and some offer fractional shares, making it possible to own a piece of high-value companies with a modest investment. This democratizes the investment process, making it feasible for a broader audience to participate in the stock market.",1
How long does it take for money to transfer into a mastercard?,"In a nutshell, as long as they (Sparkasse) choose to. I work with banks where it happens the moment I submit the transaction (so the next screen already shows the new totals), and I work with banks that make it take 3 days. In the past, Sparkasse and Raifeissenkassen were especially famous to take a looong time ('Wir nehmen mehr als Geld und Zinsen...' - they supposedly work with the money inbetween, as it is gone from the source account but not arrived in the target account yet); that might have changed (or not). Probably Sparkasse has a statement in their fineprint on how long they make it take. I would expect one business day in today's environment, but I didn't look it up.","The time it takes for money to transfer to a Mastercard typically varies depending on the transaction type. For direct deposits or electronic transfers, it can be as quick as the same day or up to 3 business days. However, for transfers from banks or financial institutions, it can take anywhere from 1 to 5 business days. Transactions such as refunds from merchants back onto a Mastercard might take up to 7-10 business days, depending on the merchant's processing times and the card issuer's policies. Always check with the specific bank or financial institution issuing the Mastercard for the most accurate timing.",1
Does borrowing from my 401(k) make sense in my specific circumstance?,"I completely agree with Pete that a 401(k) loan is not the answer, but I have an alternate proposal: Reduce your 401(k) contribution down to the 4% that you get a match on.  If you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up, those need to be addressed before retirement savings.  You'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off.   If your company matches 50% (meaning you have to contribute 8% to get the 4% match), then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k) altogether. A 100% match is very hard to give up, but a 50% match is less difficult.  You have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match.  Plus, the pain of knowing you're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible.  It seems to me that I would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $150 per month.  No, you'd be deferring $150 per month for an additional two years, and not reducing debt at all, just moving it to a different lender. Interest rate is not your problem.  Right now you're paying less than $30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $270 in principal, and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years.  You're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings.   I would buckle down, reduce expenses wherever possible (cable? cell phone? coffee? movies? restaurants?) until you get these debts paid off.  You make $70,000 per year, or almost $6,000 per month.  I bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $1,100 fairly quickly. Then the next $1,200 should come twice as fast. Then attack the next $4,000. (You can argue whether the $1,200 should come first because of the interest rate, but in the end it doesn't matter - either one should be paid off very quickly, so the interest saved is negligible) Maybe you can get one of them paid off, get yourself some breathing room, then loosen up a little bit, but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise. Some more drastic measures:","Borrowing from your 401(k) can sometimes make sense if you're facing a severe financial predicament that cannot be addressed through other means, such as high-interest debt or medical expenses. However, doing so should be approached with caution. While it allows you access to funds without a credit check and the interest you pay goes back into your account, it also reduces your investment growth potential and if you leave your job, the loan often becomes due in full. Evaluate alternative options first and consider the long-term impact on your retirement savings before proceeding with a 401(k) loan.",1
Does FIFO cost basis applies across multiple accounts?,"To sum up: My question came from misunderstanding what cost basis applies to. Now I get it that it applies to stocks as physical entities. Consider a chain of buys of 40 stock A with prices $1-$4-$10-$15 (qty 10 each time) then IRS wants to know exactly which stock I am selling. And when I transfer stocks to different account, that cost basis transfers with them. Cost basis is included in transfers, so that removes ambiguity which stock is being sold on the original account. In the example above, cost basis of 20 stocks moved to a new account would probably be $1 x 10 and $4 x 10, i.e. FIFO also applies to transfers.","Yes, the FIFO (First In, First Out) cost basis can be applied across multiple accounts, but it is not automatically universal. It's important for investors to manually track and specify the FIFO method for each account if they wish to consistently apply it across their investment portfolio. Financial institutions typically apply cost basis methods, including FIFO, on an account-by-account basis. Therefore, communication with your financial advisor or the institution managing your accounts is essential to ensure the FIFO method is uniformly applied if that is your preference for realizing capital gains or losses.",1
Student loan payments and opportunity costs,"I'll use similar logic to Dave Ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we're talking about paying off any debt early.  Also, consider this tweet and what it means for student loans - to you, they're debt, to the government, they're assets. If you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost, would you borrow money at [interest rate] to obtain a degree?  Put it in the housing way, if you paid off your home, would you pull out an equity loan/line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings?  I can't answer the question for you or anyone else, as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either. I can tell you two observations I've made about this question (it comes a lot with housing) over time.  First, it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0% interest rate credit cards to buy stocks (or float bills for a while).  How quickly people forget what it feels (and looks like) when you see your financial assets drop 50-60%!  It's not Wall Street that's greedy, it's most average investors.  Second, people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action; as Carnegie said, ""Concentration is the key to wealth"" and concentrating your financial energy on something, instead of throwing it all over the place, can simplify your life.  This is one reason why lottery winners don't keep their winnings: their financial behavior was rotten before winning, and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior.  Even if you get paid a lot or little, that's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else (like money, happiness, peace of mind, etc) follows.","As a Wealth Management Advisor, when considering student loan repayments, it's crucial to balance the opportunity costs involved. Repaying loans aggressively can secure a debt-free status sooner, potentially saving on interest. However, investing the excess cash instead of making extra loan payments might yield higher returns over time, depending on the loan's interest rate and market performance. Prioritize paying down high-interest debt while assessing the potential growth of investments. Every individual's financial situation is unique; thus, creating a personalized strategy that considers risk tolerance, financial goals, and current debt obligations is essential for optimizing opportunity costs.",1
what is the best way of investment which gives returns forever?,"What is the best way that I can invest money so that I can always get   returns? If you want something that doesn't require any work on your end, consider having a fee-only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other. Note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in September in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks. Bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like Russia in the 1990s. Real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there aren't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area? There may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under? Would it be to set up an FD in a bank, to buy land, to buy a rental   house, to buy a field, or maybe to purchase gold?  What investment of your own time do you plan on making here? Both in terms of understanding what your long-term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan. If you put the money in the bank, are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using? Are there any better investments? You may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there isn't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect.","The concept of an investment providing returns ""forever"" is typically embodied in the strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks, particularly those of companies with a long history of consistent dividend payments and growth. This approach, often referred to as buying ""dividend aristocrats,"" targets firms that have a strong track record of profitability and financial health. Such investments can offer a dual benefit of potential capital appreciation and recurring income through dividends, which can be reinvested or used as a steady income stream, theoretically providing returns indefinitely as long as the companies continue to perform well.",3
Recourse with Credit Card company after victimized by fraud?,"If the business is being investigated by your state's Attorney General's office, then your first call should be to that office.  They will be able to help you in a few ways, even if they can't explicitly resolve the situation, and they also would undoubtedly appreciate your information to add to their case as well. First, they may be able to tell you how other victims have had their cases resolved, particularly if any went to court on their own.  While they won't be able to provide you with personal information of the other victims unless it is public knowledge (via a court case), the information about how the other victims resolved the cases may be helpful - both to show what to do, and what not to do. Second, they may be able to put you in contact with an attorney who is handling other cases like yours. That may reduce the cost of the attorney (as they'll have already done some of the work), and may mean that the attorney is willing to work with no up front fee on the assumption of winning the case. Third, if there are options for getting your money back without a court case, the AG's office may be able to help provide those as well. If the Attorney General's office is unable to help you, then your best bet is to contact an attorney on your own - look for one who specializes in consumer protection and fraud.  This is the purpose attorneys exist for: pursuing your interests against another's.  Let them do their job.  Do make an effort to find a good, honest attorney; you may find some help on how to do this on law.se if you need it (not actual recommendations, mind you, just help with how you would go about finding one).  It sounds like your claim would be above and beyond the level of a small claims court lawsuit, but verify this in your jurisdiction; if small claims court goes up to $10,000, you may be able to pursue it there on your own - but I would still get some help from an attorney, at least finding out what you would need to win.","If you've been victimized by credit card fraud, contact your credit card company immediately to report the fraudulent transactions. Credit card issuers typically have zero-liability policies for unauthorized charges, protecting you from financial loss. You should also ask to have your current card canceled and a new card issued to prevent further fraudulent activity. The company will investigate the fraudulent activity; during this period, you won't be held responsible for the disputed charges. Additionally, it's wise to review your credit report and consider placing a fraud alert to prevent identity theft. Credit card companies often have robust fraud protection measures to assist their customers.",2
Facebook buying WhatsApp for 19 Billion. How are existing shareholders affected?,"Of course it is a dilution of existing shareholders. When you buy milk in the supermarket - don't you feel your wallet diluted a little? You give some $$$ you get milk in return. You give some shares, you get Watsapp in return. That's why such purchases must go through certain process of approval - board of directors (shareholders' representatives) must approve it, and in some cases (don't know if in this particular) - the whole body of the shareholders vote on the deal.","When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, existing shareholders of Facebook experienced a blend of effects. The immediate reaction often involves a shift in stock price due to investor sentiment on whether the acquisition is seen as beneficial or overpriced. Over the long term, if WhatsApp contributes positively to Facebook's revenue streams and strategic positioning, shareholders might benefit from share price appreciation and stronger company fundamentals. However, the initial cash and stock outlay for the acquisition, along with any assumption of debt, could pressure Facebook’s financials temporarily, affecting shareholder value depending on how efficiently the integration and growth expectations are managed.",1
Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market?,"Fiduciary They are obligated by the rules of the exchanges they are listed with. Furthermore, there is a strong chance that people running the company also have stock, so it personally benefits them to create higher prices. Finally, maybe they don't care about the prices directly, but by being a good company with a good product or service, they are desirable and that is expressed as a higher stock price.  Not every action is because it will raise the stock price, but because it is good for business which happens to make the stock more valuable.","A company cares about its stock price for several reasons: it reflects the market's confidence in its future prospects, affecting its reputation and ability to attract investment. A higher share price makes it more attractive for acquisitions, as its stock can be used as currency for mergers or purchases. It also impacts the company’s ability to raise capital through equity offerings. For employees and management with stock-based compensation, the share price affects their personal wealth and motivation. Lastly, a strong stock performance can act as a defense against takeover attempts, protecting the company’s autonomy.",1
Using Loan to Invest - Paying Monthly Installments with Monthly Income,"The best strategy? Skip the loan. Find a way to invest for a low starting amount via a retirement account (such as a 401K or IRA in the United States) or non-retirement account. Use this money to buy individual stocks or funds. Every month put money from your regular income into this investment account. Then buy more stocks or sell if the conditions change based on what the market is doing, not to meet a loan payment. This helps you because if the price fluctuates you will buy more shares if the price is down; and you will buy fewer shares when the price is up. It also allows you to skip worrying about how to repay the loan. It also means that you not have to pull more money out of savings to make the final loan payments if it doesn't make as much money as you plan. Regarding your math. This is a better understanding of the money flow than the earlier question.","Using a loan to invest and pay it off with monthly income can be a risky strategy, often referred to as ""leverage investing."" While it has the potential for higher returns by investing borrowed money, it also magnifies potential losses if investments perform poorly. It's crucial to ensure the rate of return on the investment exceeds the cost of the loan, including interest rates and any fees. This approach requires a robust and stable monthly income to manage loan repayments without compromising other financial obligations. It's advisable to assess your risk tolerance and consult a financial advisor before proceeding with this strategy.",1
What options exist to make money in the US on a work-restricted visa?,"Income generated from online sales is not considered ""passive income"", so you need to be authorized to work in the U.S. Those without work authorization can acquire passive income (through investments, lending, competition/contest earnings, etc.) In order to sell products on eBay (the description you've given leads me to believe that this is operated as a business), you need to be authorized to work in the U.S., and register a business. See:","On a work-restricted visa in the U.S., options to make money legally include passive income sources such as interest from savings accounts or certificates of deposit, dividends from investments in stocks or mutual funds, and rental income if you own property. You can also invest in bonds or participate in a business as a silent partner, assuming these activities don’t breach your visa restrictions. It’s crucial to consult with an immigration lawyer or tax advisor to ensure compliance with the specific terms of your visa and understand the tax implications of your investments.",1
Placing limit order and stop loss on same stock at same time,"From your question, I am guessing that you are intending to have stoploss buy order. is the stoploss order is also a buy order ?  As you also said, you seems to limit your losses, I am again guessing that you have short position of the stock, to which you are intending to place a buy limit order and buy stoploss order (stoploss helps when when the price tanks). And also I sense that you intend to place buy limit order at the price below the market price. is that the situation?  If you place two independent orders (one limit buy and one stoploss buy). Please remember that there will be situation where two orders also get executed due to market movements. Add more details to the questions. it helps to understand the situation and others can provide a strategic solution.","Placing a limit order and a stop loss on the same stock simultaneously is a strategic approach often used in trading to manage risk while targeting specific profits. A limit order specifies the price at which you wish to buy or sell a stock, ensuring you don't pay more or sell for less than your targeted price. A stop loss, on the other hand, is designed to limit your loss by automatically selling the stock if it reaches a certain price point. This combination allows traders to set their maximum acceptable loss and desired profit level in advance, automating part of the trading process for efficiency and emotional detachment. Nonetheless, traders should monitor market conditions and adjust orders as necessary since rapid market movements might cause stop loss orders to execute at less favorable prices.",1
Why could rental costs for apartments/houses rise while buying prices can go up and down?,"I am from Australia, so my answer is based on my experience over here, however it should be similar for the USA. Generally, what determines both the price of houses/apartments and the rents for them is supply and demand. When there is high demand and low supply prices (or rents) generally go up. When there is low demand and high supply prices (or rents) usually go down. What can sometimes happen when house prices go down, is that the demand can drop but so can supply. As the prices drop, developers will make less money on building new houses, so stop building new houses. Other developers can go bankrupt. As less people (including investors) are buying houses, and more people (including investors) try to sell their existing houses, there will be more people looking to rent and less rental properties available to rent. This produces a perfect storm of high demand and low supply of rental properties, causing rents to rise strongly. When the property prices start to go up again as demand increases, there is a shortfall of new properties being built (due to the developers not building during the downturn). At this time developers start to build again but there is a lag time before the new houses can be completed. This lack of supply puts more pressure on both house prices and rents to go up further. Until equilibrium between supply and demand is realised or an oversupply of rental properties exists in the market, rents will continue to rise.","Rental costs for apartments and houses may rise consistently due to factors such as increased demand for rentals, inflation leading to higher property management costs, and limited housing supply. While the buying prices of homes can fluctuate due to broader economic conditions, interest rates, and real estate market dynamics, rental prices trend upwards as more people might choose or be forced to rent, either due to affordability issues, declining homeownership rates, or lifestyle choices. This steady demand for rental properties tends to keep pushing rental costs up, even if the purchase prices of houses experience volatility.",1
What do I need to do to form an LLC?,"I know that there are a lot service on the internet helping to form an LLC online with a fee around $49. Is it neccessarry to pay them to have an LLC or I can do that myself? No, you can do it yourself. The $49 is for your convenience, but there's nothing they can do that you wouldn't be able to do on your own. What I need to know and what I need to do before forming an LLC? You need to know that LLC is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections. As such, it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser, i.e.: a Virginia-licensed attorney. Is it possible if I hire some employees who living in India? Is the salary for my employees a expense? Do I need to claim this expense? This, I guess, is entirely unrelated to your questions about LLC. Yes, it is possible. The salary you pay your employees is your expense. You need to claim it, otherwise you'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud. What I need to do to protect my company? For physical protection, you'd probably hire a security guard. If you're talking about legal protections, then again - talk to a lawyer. What can I do to reduce taxes? Vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes. Most of them never deliver though. Otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing - tax planning. That is - plan ahead your expenses, time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc. Talk to your tax adviser, who should be a EA or a CPA licensed in Virginia. What I need to know after forming an LLC? You'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your State (annual reports, tax reports, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, etc). Most are the same for same proprietors and LLCs, so you probably will not be adding to much extra red-tape. Your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this, but you can also research yourself on the Virginia department of corporations/State department (whichever deals with LLCs).","To form a Limited Liability Company (LLC), you need to choose a unique business name compliant with your state's naming requirements, file Articles of Organization with your state’s secretary of state office, pay the filing fee, and appoint a registered agent for legal documents. Additionally, obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS for tax purposes, and depending on your business type and location, secure the necessary licenses and permits. Drafting an LLC operating agreement, although not required in all states, is highly recommended to outline the ownership and operational procedures of your LLC.",2
"What options do I have at 26 years old, with 1.2 million USD?","That's what I would do; 1.2 million dollars is a lot of money, but it doesn't make you retired for the rest of your life: There is a big crisis coming soon (my personal prediction) in the next 10-15 years, and when this happens: government will hold your money if you leave them in the bank (allowing you to use just part of it; you will have to prove the reason you need it), government will pass bills to make it very hard to close your investment positions, and government will pass new laws to create new taxes for people with a lot of money (you). To have SOME level of security I would separate my investment in the following: 20% I would buy gold certificates and the real thing (I would put the gold in a safe(s)). 20% I would put in bitcoin (you would have to really study this if you are new to crypto currency in order to be safe). 40% I would invest in regular finance products (bonds, stocks and options, FX). 20% I would keep in the bank for life expenses, specially if you don't want work for money any more. 20% I would invest in startup companies exchanging high risk hoping for a great return. Those percentages might change a little depending how good/confident you become after investing, knowing about business, etc...","At 26 with $1.2 million, you have several investment avenues to explore. Consider diversifying your portfolio across stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate to spread risk and leverage growth opportunities. Investing in retirement accounts like a Roth IRA can also be beneficial, offering tax-free growth. Incorporating alternative investments such as private equity or commodities might add diversity. It’s also crucial to set aside an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses. Given your age and potential long-term investment horizon, adopting a slightly aggressive investment strategy may yield significant compounding benefits over time. Consultation with a financial professional can tailor these options to your personal goals and risk tolerance.",1
"In general, is it financially better to buy or to rent a house?","Which is generally the better option (financially)? Invest. If you can return 7-8% (less than the historical return of the S&P 500) on your money over the course of 25 years this will outperform purchasing personal property. If you WANT to own a house for other reason apart from the financial benefits then buy a house. Will you earn 7-8% on your money, there is a pretty good chance this is no because investors are prone to act emotionally.","The financial benefit of buying versus renting a house largely depends on individual circumstances, including financial stability, long-term plans, and local housing market conditions. Buying a house can offer long-term financial advantages like building equity, potential appreciation in value, and tax benefits. However, it also involves higher upfront costs, maintenance responsibilities, and less flexibility to move. Renting offers more flexibility, predictable monthly expenses, and no maintenance costs, making it suitable for those uncertain about their long-term residency or without the means for a down payment. Evaluating personal financial goals and market trends is crucial in making this decision.",1
Are there index tracking funds that avoid the “buy high - sell low” problem?,"There are some index funds out there like this - generally they are called ""equal weight"" funds.  For example, the Rydex S&P Equal-Weight ETF.  Rydex also has several other equal weight sector funds","Yes, there are index-tracking funds designed to mitigate the ""buy high, sell low"" problem often associated with traditional indexed mutual funds or ETFs. These funds implement strategies such as equal weighting, fundamentally weighting, or using smart beta strategies that don’t strictly follow market capitalization weights. This approach can help reduce the tendency to automatically buy more of the most expensive stocks and sell the cheaper ones during rebalancing periods. However, while these strategies aim to improve returns or reduce volatility compared to a cap-weighted index, they still carry their own set of risks and challenges, and outcomes can vary.",1
Cons of withdrawing money from an Roth IRA account?,"One ""con"" I have not yet seen mentioned: retirement accounts are generally protected from creditors in a bankruptcy.  There are limits and exceptions, Roth has a 1.2 million dollar limit and can be split by a divorce QDRO for instance.  Link Since it seems you have no income this year, you may may be raiding your IRA for living expenses.   If there is a chance you may declare bankruptcy in the next year or so, consider doing that first and raid the IRA for seed money after.","Withdrawing funds from a Roth IRA account prematurely (before age 59½ and before the account has been open for five years) can be disadvantageous due to the potential taxes and penalties on earnings. While contributions can generally be withdrawn tax-free at any time, earnings may be subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if taken out before meeting the age and five-year holding period requirements. This not only reduces your immediate funds but also diminishes the potential for tax-free growth over time, compromising your long-term retirement savings strategy.",1
Is it necessary to pay tax if someone lends me money to put into my mortgage?,"This answer is specifically for the UK, but one building society has an account set up specifically for this. You actually refer your friend/family member to set up an account and then it can be linked to your mortgage. They don't get any interest for their account as it's all offset against your mortgage. If you then happen to give them a cash gift (up to £250 or possibly £3000 per year, I can't work out which is the reliable number, as of 2015) then it's all completely above board.","No, if someone lends you money to put towards your mortgage, you are not required to pay taxes on that money because it is a loan that you're expected to repay, not income or a financial gift. However, if the agreement includes you not having to repay the money, it could be considered a gift, and the giver, not the recipient, may be responsible for any applicable gift taxes, depending on the amount and their circumstances. Always ensure proper documentation to clarify such transactions to avoid any tax misunderstandings.",1
How to reconcile performance with dividends?,"Just look at the published annualized returns, which are inclusive of distributions and fees. From the Vanguard website: Average annual returns include changes in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.","In reconciling performance with dividends, investors should consider total return, which combines the capital appreciation (or depreciation) of an investment with its dividend payouts. To accurately assess an investment's overall performance, one should reinvest dividends to capture the compounding effect, which is crucial for long-term growth. This method allows a more comprehensive view of how dividends contribute to the attractiveness of an investment beyond mere price appreciation. Comparing this total return to benchmarks or other investments provides a clearer insight into how well the investment is performing in generating both income and capital growth.",1
"Should I be more aggressive in a Roth IRA, 401k, or taxable account?","I think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion about why you put what type of investment in a taxable vs. tax-advantaged account. It is not so much about risk, but type of return. If you're investing both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts, you can benefit by putting more tax-inefficient investments inside your tax-advantaged accounts. Some aggressive asset types, like real estate, can throw off a lot of taxable income. If your asset allocation calls for investing in real estate, holding it in a 401k or IRA can allow more of your money to remain invested, rather than having to use it to pay for taxes. And if you're holding in a Roth IRA, you get that tax free. But bonds, a decidedly non-aggressive asset, also throw off a lot of taxable income. You're able to hold them in a tax-advantaged account and not pay taxes on the income until you withdraw it from the account (or tax free in the case of a Roth account.) An aggressive stock fund that is primarily expected to provide returns via price appreciation would do well in a taxable account because there's likely little tax consequence to you until it is sold.","In a Roth IRA or 401k, being more aggressive can be advantageous, especially if you have a long time horizon before retirement. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance the compounding of returns on riskier, high-growth investments. Specifically, a Roth IRA allows your investments to grow and be withdrawn tax-free in retirement, making it a great vehicle for aggressive investments. Aggressiveness in a taxable account can also yield higher returns but bear in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends, which can diminish net returns. Ultimately, your risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation should guide your decision.",1
Wash sales + restricted stock in US,"grant date or vesting date?
A: For restricted stock, I think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from IRS Pub 550: Wash Sales: Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade I base this on these two quotes from IRS Pub 525: Restricted Property: any income from the property, or the right to use the property, is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property. - Until the property becomes substantially vested, it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you, usually your employer.  So on the vest date: The transfer is taxable Ownership is transferred to you That seems close enough to ""a fully taxable trade"" for me.  Maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date. See Pub 525: Restricted Property: Choosing to include in income for year of transfer. Obviously, if this is important you should consult your tax advisor.  Technicalities aside, I don't think it passes the sniff test. You're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests. If you're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date, that smells like a wash sale to me.","In the United States, wash sales and restricted stock represent two distinct concepts under tax and securities law. A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and repurchases the same or substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale. This transaction prevents the investor from claiming the loss for tax purposes. Restricted stock, on the other hand, refers to shares issued to an employee as equity compensation but subjected to certain conditions and trading restrictions until vested. These restrictions typically ensure that employees remain with the company for a certain period before fully owning the stock. Both concepts are highly relevant in wealth management for optimizing investment strategies and tax planning for clients.",1
Simple and safe way to manage a lot of cash,"If this money is intended to be used for retirement and depending on how old ""older"" is, it sounds a little risky to be putting too much money in a stock based mutual fund.  While the CDs may seem like crappy investments right now, it is important to down-shift risk as you get closer to retirement because this person won't have as much time to recover if the markets take another big dip.","A simple and safe way to manage a substantial amount of cash involves diversifying investments across asset classes like equities, bonds, and potentially real estate, while also maintaining a portion in a high-yield savings account or short-term certificates of deposit for liquidity and safety.

How can I use debt management to improve my financial situation?,Debt management plans address unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans. Debt management usually happens through: \n1. DIY debt management\n2. Debt management with a credit counselor\n3. Debt relief company,"Debt management can significantly enhance your financial situation by consolidating high-interest debts into a single, lower-interest loan or payment plan, thereby reducing the total interest paid over time. This strategy improves cash flow and can contribute to a faster debt payoff. Additionally, focusing on debts with the highest interest rates first (debt avalanche method) or those with the smallest balances (debt snowball method) can motivate you by showing quick wins. Effective debt management also includes negotiating better terms with creditors and avoiding accruing further debt, all of which can lead to an improved credit score and financial stability.",1
How much should a graduate student attempt to save?,"First, don't save anything in a tax sheltered vehicle. You will be paying so little tax that there will be essentially no benefit to making the contributions, and you'll pay tax when they come out. Tax free compounding for 40 years is terrific, but start that after you're earning more than a stipend. Second, most people recommend having a month's expenses readily available for emergencies. For you, that would be $1500. If you put $100 a month aside, it will take over a year to have your emergency fund. It's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace, so as to have your emergency money in place sooner. However, the ""emergencies"" usually cited are things like home repair, car repair, needing to replace your car, and so on. Since you are renting your home and don't have a car, these emergencies aren't going to happen to you. Ask yourself, if your home was destroyed, and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions (including furniture), how much would you need? (Keep in mind any insurance you have.) The only emergency expense I can't guess about is health costs, because I live in Canada. I would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund, just because grad student living is so tight to the bone (been there, and 25 years ago I had $1200 a month, so it must be harder for you now.) If you do manage to save up $1500, and you've really been pinching to do that (walking instead of taking the bus, staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food) let up on yourself when you hit the target. Delaying your graduation by a few months because you're not mentally sharp due to hunger or tiredness will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $200 a month for 2 or 3 years. The former is 3-6 months of your new salary, the latter 5-7K. You know what you're likely to earn when you graduate, right?","As a graduate student, focusing on balancing between immediate financial needs and future savings is crucial. Aiming to save 10-15% of any income you receive is an excellent starting point, although this can vary depending on your specific circumstances, such as debt levels, living expenses, and employment status. Remember, even small amounts can add up over time due to the power of compound interest. It's also important to establish an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses to mitigate unexpected financial setbacks. Prioritizing high-interest debts and responsibly managing any student loans should accompany your savings efforts.",1
Do market shares exhaust?,"As @ApplePie pointed out in their answer, at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company. One subtlety you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares. That is, you don't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of ABC, you put in an order to buy 1 share of ABC for $10. If no one is willing to sell a share of ABC for $10, then your order will go unfilled. This happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock. Practically speaking, there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares. You can put in a market order for 1 share of ABC, which says essentially ""I want one share of ABC, and I will pay whatever the market deems to be the price"". Your broker will find you 1 share, but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay! While it's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price, it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price. This causes a market crash, as in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held, and for a few days, very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price.","No, market shares do not exhaust in the way physical resources can. Market share refers to the percentage of an industry's sales that a particular company controls. It can shift and change over time as companies grow, enter, or exit markets, but the concept itself does not ""run out."" Market dynamics, competition, innovation, and consumer preferences drive changes in market share. Therefore, as long as there are functioning markets and industries, the distribution of market share among companies will continue to evolve, but it won't exhaust in a finite sense.",2
Why do employer contributions count against HSA limits?,"am I comparing apples and oranges? Yes - different purposes, different laws, different regulations.  One rationale could be that HSA benefits are immediate while retirement benefits are deferred, so the benefit of employer contributions are not felt until retirement and thus do not need as stringent a limit, but that's a complete guess.","Employer contributions to a Health Savings Account (HSA) count against the annual contribution limits because the IRS considers both employer and employee contributions as part of the total allowed HSA contribution for the year. This combined limit helps to ensure the tax-advantaged status of HSAs remains targeted towards healthcare savings, preventing excessive tax-exempt contributions. The annual limit is an aggregate cap to maintain the program's integrity and fairness, ensuring that the total funds contributed to the HSA, inclusive of both employer and employee contributions, do not exceed the stipulated maximum allowed by the IRS.",2
Can I rely on my home equity to finance large home repairs?,"Yes, a HELOC is great for that. I just had my roof done last month (~$15K, ""ugh"") and pretty much every major contractor in my area had a 0% same-as-cash for at least 12 months. So that helps - any balance that I don't bank by 11/15/2015 will be on the HELOC.","Using your home equity to finance large home repairs can be a viable option, but it requires careful consideration. It involves borrowing against the value of your home, typically through a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). This method can offer lower interest rates compared to other forms of borrowing, and potentially tax-deductible interest. However, it also increases your debt and puts your home at risk if you can't make the repayments. It's crucial to ensure the repairs add significant value to your home or are necessary for maintenance before proceeding. Always evaluate your ability to meet the repayment terms.",1
Impact of RMD on credit worthiness,"The actual policy will vary based on the specific bank.  But, if I were in your shoes I'd include RMDs in my stated income for credit card purposes.","Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, can affect an individual's credit worthiness indirectly. While RMDs themselves do not directly impact credit scores or credit reports, the additional taxable income they generate could influence one's financial situation. If not managed properly, the increase in taxable income could lead to higher tax liabilities, potentially straining finances and causing difficulties in meeting debt obligations, which in turn could negatively affect credit scores. Conversely, if managed wisely, RMDs can bolster financial stability, supporting ongoing credit worthiness by demonstrating sound financial management.",2
Who should pay taxes in my typical case?,"Once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there. Currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the IRS cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account. The taxes due will be based on your mom's tax rate. As a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf. Also legally that money currently belongs to her. Any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such. A better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name. This way the money is still yours (you just don't have control of it until you turn 18). While probably not an issue here, the transferring of money between you and your mom (and then back) is considered a gift by the IRS. If the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion. Based on the clarification that the question is in reference to India: while I don't know the particulars of the law in India my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains. The main difference that I would see been India and the US would be the gift tax / exclusions. Unless someone else knows otherwise I would still expect the law in India to see the current account as being the property of the mother.","In your typical case as a Wealth Management advisor, the responsibility for tax payments primarily falls upon the individual, trust, or entity that earns income, receives investment profits, or owns taxable assets. The specifics, however, can vary widely based on the jurisdiction, the nature of the income, and available tax planning strategies. Efficient tax planning and consulting with a tax professional can help optimize tax liabilities and ensure compliance with local and international tax laws, potentially reducing the overall tax burden through legal avenues such as deductions, credits, and tax-efficient investment structures.",1
Does high inflation help or hurt companies with huge cash reserves?,"This is a reasonable question about inflation.  I would just like to note that inflation is nearly zero at the moment.  And interest rates are very low.  For a stable enterprise, borrowing cash is very easy right now.  Naturally, things could change in a year.  But the reason a company like Microsoft (but not just them) might hoard cash right now is that it gives them weight for buying up smaller firms, muscling rivals, and signaling their comfort level with the way things look for them.  It could also be because they are out of ideas for what to invest in, and/or are waiting for conditions to change before making any big decisions.  But with an interest rate at close to zero, and an inflation rate at close to zero, at the moment, inflation is not going to be a consideration in evaluating such a company.","High inflation generally hurts companies with huge cash reserves because the purchasing power of their cash diminishes over time. Cash reserves do not typically generate returns that outpace inflation, leading to a decrease in real value. This scenario forces companies to seek investment opportunities with higher returns to maintain or grow their wealth. However, it can also offer an advantage if these companies use their cash reserves strategically to acquire assets or competitors at lower relative costs during inflationary periods, or to invest in inflation-resistant assets, thereby potentially turning a challenging economic condition into an opportunity.",1
"If I have $1000 to invest in penny stocks online, should I diversify risk and invest in many of them or should I invest in just in one?","There's a grey area where investing and speculating cross. For some, the stock market, as in 10% long term return with about 14% standard deviation, is too risky. For others, not enough action.  Say you have chosen 10 penny stocks, done your diligence, to the extent possible, and from a few dozen this is the 10 you like. I'd rather put $100 into each of 10 than to put all my eggs in one basket. You'll find that 3 might go up nicely, 3 will flounder around, and 4 will go under. The gambler mentality is if one takes off, you have a profit.  After the crash of '08, buying both GM and Ford at crazy prices actually worked, GM stockholders getting nothing, but Ford surviving and now 7X what I bought it for.  Remember, when you go to vegas, you don't drop all your chips on Red, you play blackjack/craps as long as you can, and get all the free drinks you can.","Given the inherent volatility and risk associated with penny stocks, it is advisable to diversify your investment across multiple penny stocks rather than putting all your funds into a single one. Diversification can help mitigate some of the risks by spreading potential losses among different investments. However, bear in mind that investing in penny stocks is highly speculative and can result in significant losses, so it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before proceeding.",2
Why is the fractional-reserve banking not a Ponzi scheme?,"The fundamental underlying difference between a bank and a Ponzi scheme: When a bank lends money and charges interest, people can do things with that borrowed money which are worth it. (Building factories, starting businesses, or just enjoying the comfort and warmth of a single-family home instead of paying rent). This is why fractional-reserve banking is able to work. People may also do things which do not necessarily turn a financial profit (financing large purchases on a credit card) but are worth it in terms of an expenditure. They may also do stupid things (financing useless purchases on a credit card and wasting their money) or otherwise dispose of the money poorly (the new business fails, the home's value plummets, etc). A Ponzi scheme never really bothered to do useful things with the money. Social Security has been mentioned. Part of social security's setup involves the current population of workers paying the current population of retirees; their own retirements will have to be financed by the next generation. This design is not intrinsically a Ponzi scheme: both the population and the economy ought to remain growing for the intermediate future, so there will be at least as much money (and probably much more) for them to pay those bills. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, the idea that it will continue to attract new money to pay out existing claims is a realistic one. The real questions of its sustainability are a matter of specifics: is it collecting enough money to remain functional in the future, or is it outpacing the growth of the economy and the population?","Fractional-reserve banking differs fundamentally from a Ponzi scheme on several key fronts. Primarily, it is a legitimate and regulated system where banks keep a fraction of deposits as reserves and use the remainder to provide loans, effectively creating money through the lending process. This system is backed by central bank policies and governmental regulations to ensure stability and protect depositors. Conversely, a Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam promising high returns with little risk to investors, paying earlier investors with the new investors' money until it inevitably collapses. Unlike Ponzi schemes, fractional-reserve banking is an essential component of the global financial system, facilitating economic growth and liquidity.",1
Is it possible for me to keep my credit card APR at 0% permanently?,"Banks don't care that you are responsible cardholder. They care to make money. Interest rates are basically 0% by government policy and the banks charge their responsible cardholders 20% interest rates. Think about that for one second, and realize they really do not care about your ability to avoid paying interest, they only need you to 'slip up' one month during your entire lifetime to make a profit from you. It is in their interest for you to get into a spending habit, from 0% promo rates, so that eventually a frivolous purchase or life changing event causes a balance to stay on the card for over one month.","Keeping your credit card APR at 0% permanently is highly unlikely. Credit card companies typically offer 0% APR as a promotional rate for a limited time, usually ranging from 6 to 21 months, to attract new customers or encourage spending. Once the promotional period expires, the APR will increase to a higher, regular rate. Some consumers try to maintain a low APR by transferring balances to new cards with 0% introductory offers before the current offer ends, but this strategy could affect your credit score and may not be sustainable in the long run.",1
Buying my first car out of college,I've seen this approach to buying/funding cars described in a couple of different ways over the years. Random thoughts:,"Congratulations on considering your first car purchase! It’s crucial to balance your desire for a vehicle with your overall financial health. Opt for a car you can afford without stretching your budget too thinly—consider pre-owned options for better value. Ensure the monthly payments, insurance, fuel, and maintenance costs fit within your post-college budget. Financing the purchase with a low-interest loan can build your credit score, but strive for a sizable down payment to decrease the loan amount. This purchase is a significant step, so blend practicality with your personal needs to make a decision that supports your financial future.",1
Low risk withdrawal from market. Is there a converse to dollar-cost-averaging?,"When you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts, or start receiving pension and social security funds. In addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts.  But even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative. Depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments. The proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate. During retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions. What to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire.   If your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure. You will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non-retirement investment account. If trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on. Again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure.  Of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle, family obligations, or winning the lottery.","Yes, the converse of dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which involves systematically investing a fixed amount of money into the market at regular intervals, is known as a systematic withdrawal plan or dollar-cost harvesting. This strategy involves regularly withdrawing a fixed amount of money or units from an investment portfolio. It aims to mitigate market risk during the withdrawal phase, ensuring investors can generate cash flow from their investments in a disciplined manner, similar to how DCA reduces the risk of investing a lump sum during the accumulation phase. This approach can be beneficial for retirees looking for consistent income streams while aiming to preserve their capital over time.",1
Is stock in a private corporation taxable?,"This stock is the same as any other, but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities.  You (the person) will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name.  You'll also owe ""regular"" tax if you draw a salary, etc.  The fact that it may be ""your"" company does not change these things. The company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it's nominally exchanging things of equal value, say $100 in cash for $100 in stock.  In order to sell stock, however, you MIGHT need to register with the SEC depending on how you're going about finding your investors, so keep that in mind.","Yes, stock in a private corporation is subject to taxation, but the specifics depend on the context of your ownership and transactions. If you receive stock as compensation, it's taxable as income at its fair market value. When selling or otherwise disposing of the stock, you'll face capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and your basis (usually what you paid for it). Additionally, if the private corporation pays dividends, those are typically taxable as income. Always consult with a tax professional for personalized advice, considering tax rules can be complex and vary by jurisdiction.",1

"Should I pay off my mortgage, begin retirement savings, or build my emergency fund?","Welcome to Money.SE. I will say upfront, Personal Finance is just that, personal, and you are likely to get multiple, perhaps conflicting, answers. Are you sure the PMI will drop off after 2 years? The rules are specific, and for PMI, when prepayments put you at that 78/80% LTV, your bank can require an appraisal, not automatically drop it. Talk to the banks, get confirmation, and depending what they say, keep hacking away at the mortgage.  After this, I suggest jumping on Roth IRAs. You are in the 15% bracket, and the Roth will let you deposit $5500 for each you and your wife. A great way to kickstart a higher level of retirement savings.  After this, I'm not comfortable with the emergency savings level. If you lose your job tomorrow (Funny story, my wife and I lost our's on the same day 3 years ago) and don't have enough savings (Our retirement accounts were good to just retire that day) you can easily run out of money and be late on the mortgage. It's great to prepay the mortgage to get rid of that PMI, but once there, I'd do the Roth and then focus on savings. 6 months expenses minimum.  We have a great Q&A here titled Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing in which I go in to more detail, as do 4 other members.  I am not getting on the ""investments will return more than your mortgage cost"" soapbox. A well-funded emergency fund is a very conservative bit of advice. With no matched 401(k), I suggest a balance of the Roth savings and prepayments.  From another great post, Ideal net worth by age X? Need comparison references you should have nearly 1 year's salary (90K) saved toward retirement.  Any question on my advice, add a comment and I will edit in more details.","Deciding between paying off your mortgage, starting your retirement savings, or building an emergency fund involves balancing financial prudence with future security. Prioritize starting an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses, as this will provide a financial safety net for unforeseen circumstances. Next, if your employer offers a retirement match, contribute at least enough to capture the full match since it represents an immediate, guaranteed return on your investment. Lastly, consider extra mortgage payments. Paying off your mortgage early can save on interest and offer peace of mind, but not at the expense of sacrificing necessary liquidity or missing out on higher returns from retirement investments.",1
"My university has tranfered me money by mistake, and wants me to transfer it back","Confirming whether the payment was an error The simplest method is to confirm manually with the University whether the payment was a mistake and satisfy that between yourselves. If you're concerned it's fraudulant, I recommend calling the University finance office on a phone number you find on their website, or call one of the people you know. Reversing the payment To formally reverse the payment, I'd check your Product Disclosure Statement on your account with the bank. There's almost always a fee involved where a payment is reversed. It's probably easiest to just issue the payment back to the university to an agreed BSB/Account Number.","If your university accidentally transferred money to you and now requests it back, it's essential to proceed with caution. First, contact the university directly to verify the request's legitimacy, ensuring it's not a scam. Once confirmed, keep a record of all communications regarding the transaction. Use a secure and traceable method to return the funds, like a bank transfer, and retain all transaction receipts. This process helps prevent potential legal issues and ensures both you and the university have a clear record of the rectified mistake, safeguarding your financial integrity.",1
Is it possible to make money by getting a mortgage?,"This answer is based on Australian tax, which is significantly different. I only offer it in case others want to compare situations. In Australia, a popular tax reduction technique is ""Negative Gearing"". Borrow from a bank, buy an investment property. If the income frome the new property is not enough to cover interest payments (plus maintenance etc) then the excess each year is a capital loss - which you claim each year, as an offset to your income (ie. pay less tax). By the time you reach retirement, the idea is to have paid off the mortgage. You then live off the revenue stream in retirement, or sell the property for a (taxed) lump sum.","Yes, it is possible to make money by getting a mortgage, primarily through real estate investments. By leveraging borrowed capital to purchase a property, you can potentially earn returns if the property's value appreciates over time or generates rental income exceeding the mortgage and associated expenses. Additionally, mortgage interest deductions can provide tax benefits, enhancing the overall investment's profitability. However, this strategy involves risks, including interest rate fluctuations, property value declines, and potential difficulties in managing rental properties, so it's crucial to carefully assess these factors and your financial situation before proceeding.",1
"What should I do with my $10K windfall, given these options?","I've been listening to Dave Ramsey a lot lately, and he encourages (encourage might be too light of a word for him) this priority list for budgeting: I would strongly advise you to tackle this list before you start to think about any sizable ""fun"" spending.  If you don't have #1, set that aside first. The options you mentioned: New roof: You should ask yourself ""what is the potential cost of not getting a new roof?"" If you can save up for it a little at a time, while putting most of the rest of your money to paying off debt, that's what I would do.  Unless, of course, there is damage or risk of damage to your house by not doing it now. Then, you need to do the same measurement (of doing the roof now) against the goal of saving three to six months of expenses.  Especially in your case, with your mortgage underwater, you want to be sure you are prepared should anything happen (for example, losing a job, and potentially being forced to move for a new job). Cars/student loan: (Refer to #3 above — in other words, yes).","Investing a $10K windfall wisely depends on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it off first, as it offers a guaranteed return by saving you from future interest payments. If you're debt-free, building or reinforcing an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account is prudent, ensuring it covers 3-6 months of expenses. With those foundations in place, investing in a diversified portfolio through a low-cost index fund or a retirement account (IRA) can provide long-term growth, taking advantage of compound interest and tax benefits where applicable. Each option should be weighed against your financial goals, whether that's stability, growth, or a blend of both.",2
Does doing your “research”/“homework” on stocks make any sense?,"TL;DR: Sure, ""do your own homework"" is sometimes a cop out. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our homework. I agree that in many cases this is a cop-out by commentators. However, even if you believe in perfect market efficiency, there is benefit in ""doing your homework"" for many reasons. One of which you already mention in the question: different stocks all with the same ""value"" might have widely ranging risk. Another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences. High dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others. One stock might be priced at $40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product. This might make this stock very risky with a 20% of being $150 in 12 months, and a 80% chance of being $20. Another stock might be priced at $40 because the company is a cash cow, declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $0.40 per quarter. Low risk, but also with some potential tax disadvantages. Another stock might be priced at $40 because it's a high growth stock. This would be less risky than the first example, but more risky than the second example. And the risk would be more generalized, i.e. there wouldn't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock. In short, even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly, not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone. Sometimes when we hear an analyst say ""they should have done their homework"" they are really saying ""This was a high risk/high reward stock. They should have known that this had a potential downside."" And that all assumes that we believe in 100% pure market efficiency. Which many disagree with, at least to some extent. For example, if we instead subscribe to Peter Lynch's theories about ""local knowledge"", we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts. A professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company. (This is especially true of small and mid cap stocks.) If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it is entirely feasible (at least to me) that you could be able to do a better job of ""doing homework"" on CREE than the analysts. Or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work, and you know that the latest version stinks, then you will likely know more than the analyst does. I think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor. We could say to ourselves ""the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine, I'm just going to do what they tell me to do."" And 99% of the time, that is the right thing to do. But if we do our ""homework"" anyway, and research the symptoms, diagnoses, and drugs ourselves as well, we can do get benefits. Sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions. Sometimes we can ask smarter questions. And sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor doesn't have and can actually make an important discovery they didn't know. (And, just like investing, sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals.)","Yes, doing your research or homework on stocks is crucial for making informed investment decisions. It allows you to understand the financial health, market position, and growth prospects of a company, alongside factors such as industry trends and economic conditions that could influence stock performance. While it doesn't guarantee success due to market volatility and unforeseen events, thorough research equips investors with the knowledge to assess potential risks and rewards, align investments with their financial goals, and ultimately foster more confident and rational investment choices, thus enhancing the potential for positive returns.",1
Is there any sort of tax write off for unfulfilled pay checks?,"Unfortunately, no.  Think about the numbers. If you work for me, and I pay you $1000, you owe tax on $1000. If you still work, but I don't pay you, you have no tax due, but there's no benefit for you to collect for my stealing your time.","In general, if you are a business owner and you have issued paychecks that have not been cashed, you cannot directly write off the uncashed checks as a tax deduction because the expense has already been recognized when the paycheck was issued. However, you should properly account for these uncashed checks in your financial records. If a paycheck remains uncashed for a significant amount of time, it may be considered unclaimed property under state laws and could require you to remit the funds to the state. Consult with a tax professional for specific advice related to your situation.",3

This suggests to me that you would get everything that was withheld back.","If you've been outside the U.S. for the entire year and have U.S. income, filing a Form 1040-NR is necessary to report such income. This form is designed for nonresident aliens to declare income earned in the U.S. during the tax year. This requirement ensures compliance with U.S. tax laws and helps avoid potential penalties.

What considerations are there for making investments on behalf of a friend?,"There's a sizable community of people and fiscal advisers who advocate not managing the money at all. Set your passive investor friend with automatic bank draft into a simple three/four fund portfolio of low cost index funds and never never ever trade.  See https://www.bogleheads.org/RecommendedReading.php You might be able to beat the stock market for a few years, but probably not over the long term.  Most mutual fund professionals don't.  Playing with your own money is one thing: playing with other people's money is a whole other ball game.","When making investments on behalf of a friend, it is essential to clearly understand their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline to align choices with their expectations. Establishing a formal agreement to outline these objectives, your responsibilities, and the decision-making process is crucial to avoid misunderstandings. Moreover, it is important to consider the tax implications and legal ramifications, including the potential need for a power of attorney or other formal authorization, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Finally, maintaining transparency and regular communication throughout the investment process will help foster trust and manage your friend's investment effectively.",1
Borrowing money to buy shares for cashflow?,"Buying individual/small basket of high dividend shares is exposing you to 50%+ and very fast potential downswings in capital/margin calls. There is no free lunch in returns in this respect: nothing that pays enough to help you pay your mortgage at a high rate won’t expose you to a lot of potential volatility. Main issue here looks like you have very poorly performing rental investments you should consider selling or switching up rental usage/how you rent them (moving to shorter term, higher yield lets, ditching any agents/handymen that are taking up capital/try and refinance to lower mortgage rates etc etc). Trying to use leveraged stock returns to pay for poorly performing housing investments is like spraying gasoline all over a fire. Fixing the actual issue in hand first is virtually always the best course of action in these scenarios.","Borrowing money to purchase shares for the purpose of generating cash flow, often referred to as leveraging or buying on margin, can amplify returns but also increases risk. While it may seem appealing due to the potential for higher dividends or capital gains, the costs of borrowing can reduce net income, and if share prices fall, you might face a margin call, requiring additional funds to maintain your position. This strategy demands careful consideration of your risk tolerance, market conditions, and the performance of the underlying securities. It's vital to have a well-thought-out investment plan and an exit strategy to mitigate losses.",2
How to rebalance a passive portfolio if I speculate a war is coming?,"Normally, in a war everybody suffers and the entire economy goes down. Military contractors do better than average, but the average sucks. The way to take advantage of knowing a war is coming is to leave as soon as possible. There are strategic materials that can become valuable in a war, but such investments are generally very specialized and not something an ordinary investor would be in a position to exploit.  The most profitable businesses in war are food, oil, and ammunition.","Rebalancing a passive portfolio in anticipation of a potential war involves shifting your asset allocation to more defensive sectors and investment vehicles that are traditionally less affected by geopolitical turmoil. This can include increasing your holdings in precious metals like gold, investing in high-quality government bonds, and allocating more to utilities and consumer staples stocks, which tend to be more resilient during uncertain times. It’s important to maintain diversification to manage risk effectively. Remember, speculative actions carry risks, especially in the context of a passive investment strategy, which is generally built around long-term market participation rather than short-term speculations.",1
How to learn about doing technical analysis?  Any suggested programs or tools that teach it?,"I recall the name Martin Pring. As my fundamental analysis book from grad school was the work of Graham and Dodd titled Security Analysis, Pring was the author of the books I read on technical analysis. If you've not read his work, your education has a ways to go before you hit the tools.","To learn technical analysis, consider starting with comprehensive online courses offered by platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Khan Academy, which often feature beginner to advanced level content. Many of these courses are created by experienced traders and include interactive trading simulations. For hands-on practice, tools like TradingView and MetaTrader offer rich charting tools and indicators for real-time analysis. Additionally, reading books by acclaimed authors in technical analysis, such as Martin Pring's ""Technical Analysis Explained"" or John Murphy's ""Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets,"" can provide valuable insights. Combining structured learning with continuous practice and staying updated on market trends through financial news is key.",1
Where can I find historical United States treasury note volume?,"The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) publishes these and other relevant data on their Statistics page, in the ""Treasury & Agency"" section. The volume spreadsheet contains annual and monthly data with bins for varying maturities. These data only go back as far as January 2001 (in most cases). SIFMA also publishes treasury issuances with monthly data for bills, notes, bonds, etc. going back as far as January 1980. Most of this information comes from the Daily Treasury Statements, so that's another source of specific information that you could aggregate yourself. Somewhere I have a parser for the historical data (since the Treasury doesn't provide it directly; it's only available as daily text files). I'll post it if I can find it. It's buried somewhere at home, I think.","You can find historical United States Treasury note volume data from several reputable sources. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's website is a primary source, offering detailed data through its Office of Debt Management. Additionally, financial market data providers like Bloomberg and Reuters also compile and provide historical volume information for U.S. Treasury notes. For academic or professional research, databases such as the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis offer extensive historical economic data, including Treasury note volumes, accessible to both researchers and the public.",1
"As an American working in the UK, do I have to pay taxes on foreign income?","A) a tax treaty probably covers this for the avoidance of double taxation. Tax treaties can be very cryptic and have little precedence clarifying them http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=169552,00.html B) I'm going to say NO since the source of your income is going to be US based. But the UK tax laws might also have specific verbage for resident source income. sorry it is an inconclusive answer, but should be some factors to consider and point you in the right direction.","As an American working in the UK, you are subject to U.S. taxation on your global income, including the income earned while working in the UK. The U.S. and the UK have a tax treaty designed to reduce double taxation. You can utilize the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, Foreign Tax Credit, or both to mitigate being taxed twice on the same income. However, you must file a U.S. tax return annually, reporting worldwide income and claiming any applicable exclusions or credits. It's essential to engage with a tax professional knowledgeable in expatriate tax issues to ensure compliance and optimize your tax situation.",1
Trouble sticking to a budget when using credit cards for day to day transactions?,"In your comment in response to this answer, you said that your biggest issue is oversight, which you can do by checking your online bank account regularly. Mint.com looks good but you're in Australia? Easy, check out getpocketbook.com. Using it and love it, helps a lot to track your tracking, and it's a god-send during tax time.","If you're struggling to stick to a budget while using credit cards for daily transactions, it's crucial to reassess your spending habits. Start by tracking your expenses to identify where you may be overspending. Consider setting specific spending limits on your credit cards that align with your budget categories to help enforce discipline. Additionally, take advantage of your credit card's mobile app features, such as real-time spending alerts and budgeting tools, to stay on top of your expenditures. Switching to cash or a debit card for certain budget categories can also help control spending by making the outflow of money more tangible.",3
What's the difference between Term and Whole Life insurance?,For most people Term is the way to go. I consider life insurance a necessity not an investment. See this article on SmartMoney.,"Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period, offering a death benefit if the insured passes away during the term. It's comparatively affordable but lacks cash value accumulation. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, offers lifelong coverage with a guaranteed death benefit and accumulates cash value over time. This cash value can be borrowed against and grows at a predetermined rate. Whole life insurance is more expensive due to its permanent coverage and investment component, making it a blend of life insurance and a financial savings vehicle.",1
What is the difference between FINRA share volume and NASDAQ share volume?,"Assuming the data you're referring to is this line: the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades.  FINRA could be listing the reported volume from one exchange, while the NASDAQ data might be listing the volume on all exchanges. This is an important distinction because AAV is a Canadian company that is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. The Q at the end of the line stands for NASDAQ, according to FINRA's codebook for those data. My guess is that the FINRA data is only reporting the volume for the NASDAQ exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges (Toronto, NASDAQ, NYSE, etc.) while the data straight from NASDAQ, oddly enough, is reporting the total volume. However, FINRA could also face reporting discrepancies, since it's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up-to-date volume data that the various exchanges can access.  I don't know if it's related or not, but looking at the NASDAQ historical data, it looks like the volume on March 6, the day you're asking about, was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it. For all I know, something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole. I don't remember anything in particular, but you never know.","FINRA share volume primarily refers to the trading activity, including the volume of shares traded, that occurs on platforms regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which oversees broker-dealers in the U.S. This volume includes trades in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or alternative trading systems (ATS). On the other hand, NASDAQ share volume strictly pertains to the volume of shares traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange, one of the world's leading technology securities exchanges. While both represent trading volumes, the key difference lies in the venues of the trades: one spans a broader spectrum of platforms including OTC markets, and the other is specific to the NASDAQ exchange.",2
On what time scales are stock support and resistance levels meaningful?,"Support and resistance only works as a self-fulfilling prophecy. If everyone trading that stock agrees there's a resistance at so-and-so level, and it is on such-and-such scale, then they will trade accordingly and there will really be a support or resistance. So while you can identify them at any time scale (although as a rule the time scale on which you observed them should be similar to the time scale on which you intend to use them), it's no matter unless that's what all the other traders are thinking as well. Especially if there are multiple possible S/P levels for different time scales, there will be no consensus, and the whole system will break down as one cohort ruins the other group's S/P by not playing along and vice versa. But often fundamentals are expected to dominate in the long run, so if you are thinking of trades longer than a year, support and resistance will likely become meaningless regardless. It's not like that many people can hold the same idea for that long anyhow.","Stock support and resistance levels are most meaningful on time scales that align with an investor's trading strategy. Short-term traders might focus on daily or hourly charts to identify immediate support and resistance levels, benefiting their quick decision-making process. Mid-term traders often analyze weekly charts, while long-term investors might consider monthly to yearly charts to understand broader market trends and more significant levels of support and resistance. Regardless of the time scale, it's crucial to note that these levels are more about psychology and market sentiment than precise predictive tools, and they should be used in conjunction with other analysis methods.",1
Can a entrepreneur hire a self-employed business owner?,"Yes. I can by all means start my own company and name myself CEO. If Bill Gates wanted to hire me, I'll take the offer and still be CEO of my own company. Now, whether or not my company makes money and survives is another question.  This is the basis of self-employed individuals who contract out their services.","Yes, an entrepreneur can hire a self-employed business owner for their expertise, services, or collaboration on projects. This arrangement can be beneficial for both parties, allowing the entrepreneur to harness specialized skills or products and the self-employed individual to expand their client base. The engagement typically involves a contract outlining the scope of work, duration, compensation, and other terms. It's essential for both parties to clearly define the relationship to ensure compliance with tax laws and avoid misclassification of employment status, thereby ensuring a mutually beneficial and legally sound collaboration.",1
